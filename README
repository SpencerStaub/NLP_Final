There are 7 folders in this directory split into 3 categories: Data, Pure Python Code and a Combination

In order to run the code properly Both Data and preprocesssed_data will need to be downloaded. 
From there each of the files in each respective individuals directory should run properly with attached README or Code Comments as isnstructions.

Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Data - Contains raw data of all books used in this analysis

It will additionally show the sentence the question so the user can under what the question is based off of and whether or not they want to use the question in their learning materials.
