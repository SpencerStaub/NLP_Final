Green Hair Dye
After the march, we all went back to Katarina’s house. We had cake and tea, and eventually, everyone started to head home. Right before Rasheed’s family was ready to leave, Frau Kumar’s pager buzzed. “May [KL505]I use your phone?” she asked.
    She disappeared into the kitchen, and when she returned a few minutes later, she was smiling. “They found her.”
    “Thank goodness,” Katarina said. “Where is she?”
    “In a detention center near the border.”
    “How do we get her out?” Dad asked.
    “That’s going to be trickier,” Frau Kumar said. “Depends on what paperwork you have.”
    “I don’t have anything,” Dad said. “Katarina?”
    Katarina looked down at her hands, tapping her red-manicured nails against her palm. “Sara applied for asylum when she first arrived. It was denied and she received TPS. She didn’t have a work permit. I was very clear that the au pair arrangement was a casual favor between friends. I didn’t want her to get in trouble!”
    “Did she have a driver’s license?” Frau Kumar [SB506][KL507]asked. “Or even a student ID card?”
    Katarina shook her head. “Sara didn’t drive.”
    “She has a student ID,” I said. I’d seen her use it at a museum.
    “But she kept it in her wallet,” Felix added. “Which was also stolen.”
    Frau Kumar sighed. Her T-shirt and jeans were rumpled from the protest; her light brown hair was falling out of its ponytail.
    “Sara was here legally,” Dad said. “Isn’t her name on a list or something?”
    “Most definitely,” Frau Kumar said. “But how do we prove she really is that person on the list?”
    “But we know her!” Katarina explained. “Can’t we just sign something saying we vouch for her?”
    “It’s doable,” Frau Kumar agreed. “But it will take a while.”
    “Would it help if you had a copy of her passport?” I asked.
    “Yes, of course. If we could prove who she is and that she was here legally, I could get her released quickly and—"
    “Sara said she was going to make a copy[JL509][KL510].” I interrupted. “When we went to the police station to get the stamp she needed.”[JL511]
    “I already searched her room,” Katarina said. “There’s nothing.”
    “I’d like to look,” I said.
    “Of course! Be my guest.”
    I ran upstairs. I’d never been in Sara’s room before. It looked almost identical to mine: bed, desk, bookcase. Her violin was in the corner; a picture of her, a woman, and a little boy sat in a small frame on the desk. That must be her family. The room felt oddly bare. As if she hadn’t let herself get too attached. As if she had felt she was only visiting.
    I opened the closet and saw the fancy dress hung on a hanger. There [SB513][KL514]were only a few other clothes, mainly black.
    Where would Sara put something to keep it safe?
    I searched the drawers of the desk, the bookshelves, and under the bed. All the obvious places. In a dresser drawer I found extra copies of the flyer Sara had posted at the airport: Ich suche Petra Tahirović, 44, und Eldin Tahirović, 6. Even though we knew where she was, it felt like Sara was lost too. 
    Finally, I returned to the closet. There was a shelf above the hangers. I didn’t see anything on it, but I reached up and felt around just to be sure.
    There was something there! I pulled it out and found a small box. I couldn’t read the writing on it, but there was a picture of a woman with her hair dyed green. I was about to put it back when I remembered what the old woman on the train had said. Sara had yelled Green hair![JL515][KL516] as they’d dragged her off. My heart started to beat faster.
    I shook the box. It felt empty. Of course it was. She’d used it to dye that streak of hair green when she’d first arrived. She’d kept the box only to remember her mother. Unless . . . Quickly, I opened it.
    Inside were two sheets of paper. Two photocopies, folded into quarters. I unfolded them slowly, my hands trembling. The first was a copy of Sara’s passport, the page with her photo and all her info. The second was a copy of the page with her TPS stamp.
    “I found it,” I called. But I was crying so hard, no one could hear me. I wiped my nose on my sleeve and tried again. “I found it!” I yelled.
    And they all came running.[SB517]

The next day involved waiting. Lots of waiting. It was Sunday, so the offices we needed weren’t open. Frau Kumar told us she would call if she heard anything.
    We tried to distract ourselves. Felix and I played so many games of Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht, I was afraid I was going to be dreaming about little colored pegs. We went for a walk in the vineyards. Katarina made goulash again, and it tasted even better without the bugs. Over dinner, Dad read us facts from the paper. “Approximately three hundred thousand people attended the march in Vienna last night. There were also demonstrations in Graz, Linz, Innsbruck, and Salzburg.”
    “Wow,” I said.
    “The population of Vienna is only 1.7 million.” Felix made some notes on the edge of the paper. “That’s almost 18 percent of the entire city population.”
    “I’m glad we were there,” Katarina said.
    “Me too,” Dad agreed.
    “Do you think Haider will get his million signatures?” I asked.
    “I don’t know.” Katarina sighed. “He has one week. Guess we’ll have to wait and see.”
    A week? I was supposed to go home in just over a week. Next Saturday, August 28, was the ball. Sara and Marco were supposed to[JL518][KL519] dance in the opening. We were all planning to attend, not only Dad and Katarina but Felix’s friends and their families too. It had sounded like so much fun! But without Sara, I didn’t want to go at all.
    I was just getting ready for bed when the phone rang. I stood on the stairs, my toothbrush in my mouth, as Dad picked up the receiver. “Hello?”
    He looked serious for a moment, then smiled. “Oh, thank goodness.” He listened a moment longer. “Wonderful, we’ll see you there. Thanks again.”
    “What happened?” I asked, trying not to spit toothpaste on the banister.
    “Frau Kumar got through to a friend of a friend. We’re supposed to show up at ten a.m. tomorrow at the detention center, bring the papers we have, and hopefully, we’ll be able to take Sara home.”
    I didn’t think I’d be able to sleep, but I must have, because I closed my eyes and next thing I knew, my alarm was going off.
    We piled into the car, with Katarina driving because she knew the roads best. Dad rode shotgun, and Felix and I were in the back. I didn’t think we’d all been in the car together since they’d picked me up from the airport. I remembered how squishy it had been then, with Sara in the back with Felix and me. I longed for it to be crowded again.
    It was about an hour’s drive to the detention center. We parked in a small lot out front and went inside. It was an ugly low concrete building, nothing like the massive police station we’d gone to with Sara to get her passport stamped. Frau Kumar was waiting for us when we arrived. She had on a tailored black suit and high heels, and her hair was pulled back into a severe bun. I almost didn’t recognize her—she looked so different from the casual, friendly woman we’d seen two days before.
    “Good,” she said. “You’re on time. Kids, stay here.”
    Felix and I were left on two folding chairs in the concrete-block lobby. Felix pulled out the copy of Lincoln’s speeches we’d given him for his birthday. “Do you want me to read aloud?”
    “Sure,” I said.
    Felix started to read, something about a house divided, but I was so distracted, the book might as well have been written in German. I kept folding and refolding my hands in my lap, crossing and uncrossing my legs. Was there ever a folding chair this hard and uncomfortable? Finally, we heard the click of heels on the tile floor, and Frau Kumar appeared around the corner. “Come on,” she said. “They are going to let her go.”
    We followed her down a corridor that seemed eerily familiar, though whether it reminded me of the police station or the opera or the school cafeteria back home, I couldn’t quite tell. Dad and Katarina were waiting in a small room with a table and four chairs. We went inside, but before we could even sit down, the far door opened.
    And there was Sara.
