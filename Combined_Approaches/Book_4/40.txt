So Long, Farewell, auf Wiedersehen, Adieu
It was my last morning in Austria. My suitcase was packed. My Doomsday Journals too. Only my Pig Journal remained on the desk, the sketch of the Riesenrad looking up at me like an eye. Today, I was going back to Virginia. And even though I was definitely excited to see my mom and my friends and catch up on Love on the Evening Tide, as I walked down the stairs, I sort of felt like crying.
    Katarina was in the kitchen, wearing an apron, with powdered sugar on her nose. Felix sat with a book he was only half hiding under the table; Eldin raced toy cars on the tablecloth beside him. Sara poured coffee. As I looked out the window, I could see Mrs. Tahirović watering Frau Gamperl’s flowers. Dad was standing at the stove, frying bacon.
    “There you are[JL579][KL580], Schatzi!” Katarina called. “I made Palatschinken. They’re like Austrian crepes. Delicious. You sprinkle them with powdered sugar. Alas, something went wrong, but I’m going to try . . .”
    I laughed. “The table is already covered with food! Let’s just sit down and eat.”
    Just like on my very first day, there was a basket of round Semmeln fresh from the bakery. The butter, from mountain-pastured cows, was soft as always, since Katarina kept it on the counter and not in the fridge. There was apricot jam, ham, cantaloupe, coffee, and hot chocolate. Mrs. Tahirović brought in a bouquet of flowers. We all sat down, and then Eldin picked up his eggcup and pretended it was a hat, and Sara yelled at him and Felix tried not to laugh. I ate a bite or two of pretty much everything—even the soft-boiled egg.
    “Well, Haider didn’t get his million signatures,” Dad said, glancing at the front page of the paper. “He only got four hundred thousand.”
    “That’s still a lot of people,” Felix said.
    “It is,” Katarina agreed. “But there’s a lot more that didn’t sign.”
    We were just finishing breakfast when the phone rang. “Oh, hello, Frau Kumar,” said Dad. They chatted for a bit while I cleared the table, then Dad handed the phone to me.
    “Hello?” I said.
    “Hey, Becca!” It was Rasheed. “I wanted to say goodbye. I’m glad we met.”
    “Me too,” I said.
    “I hope you come back sometime,” he said. “I’m gonna keep taking dance lessons. Maybe next time we go to a ball, I’ll only step on your foot once.”
    I laughed. “Sounds good.”
    “Can I talk to Felix? Peter and I are riding bikes to the park tomorrow[JL581][KL582] for a picnic. Thought he might like to come.”
    “Sure,” I said.
    Felix looked surprised when I handed him the phone. But after a minute, he was chatting about what he was going to bring to the picnic[SB583][KL584].
    Katarina came over then and gave me a big hug. “Thank you for helping him,” she whispered in my ear.
    “I didn’t do—[JL585]”
    “Yes, you did,” Katarina insisted. “And, Becca, you must come back soon! Maybe at Christmas? Oh, Christmas in Vienna is gorgeous! We have real candles on the trees. You’ve never seen anything so beautiful!”
    “Real candles?” I asked.
    “Yes,” she said.
    “On a dead tree? Inside your house?!”
    “Yes, of course!”
    “Do you know how many fires start from unattended candles?” I asked.
    Katarina laughed. “That’s just what your father said.”
    I glanced at Dad. He shrugged. “It’s what they do here, Becca. I’ll make sure we have a fire extinguisher on hand.”
    Katarina hugged me once more. “Just come back soon.”
    Sara and I went up to my room so she could help me finish packing[JL587][KL588]. “Are you going to stay in Austria?” I asked.
    “I want to. Frau Kumar said with my language skills, maybe she can get me a work permit.”
    “That’s wonderful!”
    “Nothing definite,” she said, but she smiled. “For now, I stay with Katarina and take classes at the university in the fall.”
    “And your mom? And Eldin?”
    “I not sure. She has a cousin in Berlin. And another one in New York. But for now, I think she’s going to move in with Frau Gamperl.”
    “Really?”
    Sara shrugged. “She has more room than Katarina. And she said she enjoys company. Your dad already helped enroll Eldin in Felix’s school. I do not know [JL589][KL590]how long they will stay, but for now, I’m glad we’re together.”
    “So much uncertainty!”
    “There’s always uncertainty, Becca. We not like to think about it, but we never really know what is going to happen. What is the expression? You could get hit by a bus?”
    “Or a Straßenbahn!”
    Sara laughed, then her face turned serious. “I thought a lot about this when I was in detention. It is important to prepare when you can, and of course you should always look both ways before you cross the street. But if you never cross at all . . .”
    “You miss out on a lot,” I finished.
    “I think the best way to deal with uncertainty,” Sara continued, “is to sit with it. Invite it in. Trust ourselves that we can handle it. And if we have family or friends to sit with us, well then, we are extra lucky.”
    “Stop acting like Fräulein Maria,” I said. “You’re making me cry.”
    “Who?” Sara asked.
    “Never mind.” And I hugged her [KL592]one last time.
***
Felix was waiting by the front door. “Hey,” he said. “Want to go for a quick walk?”
    “Sure,” I said. “I’ve got time.”
    We headed out toward the vineyard. Felix stared at his feet as we walked, shy again, as if we had gone back to our first day. “You know,” he said finally. “I called my dad last night.”
    “Really?”
    “I wanted to tell him about the ball and . . . remember how I told you about that tap dance class he took me to when I was a kid?”
    “Of course.”
    “I asked him about it. ‘I can’t believe you remember that,’ he said. ‘You were so adorable, standing in the back row, doing your best to follow along. I was so proud of you!’”
    “What?!”
    “Yeah,” Felix went on. “I was so surprised. I’d thought he was disappointed in me; and yet it turned out, he’d remembered it in a completely different way.”
    “That’s wonderful!”
    A wind blew through the grapevines making them rustle. “I’m not sure I would have been brave enough to ask him about it if I hadn’t met you.”
    “Aww, Felix. You should add it to your list.”
    “I did! Just so I could cross it off.”
    I laughed. 
    “I’m going to add more some things to my list too.”
    “Cool. Like what?”
“    Maybe ‘join the choir at school.’”
    “That’s a great idea.”
    “And at the ball,” Felix went on, “Mai mentioned she liked Alfred Hitchcock. They are showing North by Northwest at the English-language theater next week. Think I should invite her?”
    “Yes!”
He smiled.     “I’m gonna miss you, Becca.”
    “I’m gonna miss you, Felix.”
    We hugged, a bit awkwardly.
    “See you next summer?” he asked.
    “Absolutely.”
***
Dad drove me to the airport. The rest of them wanted to come too, but I said I’d like a little time alone with my father. We didn’t say much in the car; I just looked out the window. “I like Vienna, Dad,” I said finally. “I like Katarina and Felix. And you picked a great au pair. I had a wonderful summer.”
    “Yeah,” Dad agreed. “Me too.”
    “Oh, Dad!” I exclaimed. “Did I tell you about my Pig Journal?”
    “No.” He laughed. “What in the world is a Pig Journal?”
    “I decided that instead of only focusing on what might go wrong, I want to spend some time remembering everything that goes right.”
    “Oh, pig!” Dad said. “Like good luck in German.”
    “Yeah.”
    “I love that, Rebecca. Maybe I’ll start a Pig Journal too.”
    At the airport, Dad parked and checked my bag, and suddenly we were standing in front of the X-ray machine. I put my bag on the conveyor belt, and Dad walked right through. Too late, I realized I’d never told him how nervous I’d gotten going through the last time.
    There was a moment—okay, a long moment—when I wasn’t sure I could do it. But then I noticed a nearby TV playing CNN. Ms. Madden was on the screen, interviewing someone. I glanced around the airport and noticed a kid peeling a hard-boiled egg. And a teenager putting a luggage tag on a bike. A woman was hanging up a tourism poster with the Riesenrad on it. [SB598][KL599]There were crowds of people around me, and I was about to get on an airplane.
    “Becca.” My dad had stopped and turned, realizing I wasn’t following him. “Are you okay?”
    And even though my heart was pounding and my hands were sweaty, I nodded. Because I was nervous and I was okay. I took a deep breath, imagined my friends holding my hands, and just walked through.
    Mom was waiting for us at the gate. She looked different. Her hair was longer—and messy. She wore a flowery orange-and-yellow dress with a ketchup stain on one sleeve. Her new bag was dirty and scuffed, her nose sunburned, and yet when she turned toward us, she looked so happy.
    “Becca!” Mom exclaimed, running toward me. We hugged.
    “You look different,” I said.
    “Yeah,” Mom agreed. “I am different.”
    I smiled. “Me too.”
    Dad gave me a snack in a brown paper bag to eat on the plane. Instead of peanut butter, it was an Apfelstrudel from Aïda. Mom snapped a couple of pictures, and I imagined getting them developed and sending them to Dad.
    “You have a two-day stopover in New York, right?” Dad asked.
    “Yup,” Mom confirmed. “I thought it would be fun to show Becca some of the sights.”
    “Well,” Dad said, handing Mom an envelope. “Make sure not to miss Broadway.”
    Mom opened the envelope, and a puzzled look crept over her face. “I thought we’d decided . . .”
    I grabbed the envelope from her and peeked inside. There were two tickets to see Les Misérables. I squealed with delight.
    “Don’t worry,” Dad said. “Becca will do just fine.”
    We grinned at each other.[SB600]
    A minute later, Little Red Riding Hood announced that the Austrian Airlines flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport was boarding. I gave Dad one last hug, and as Mom and I walked down the gangway, I realized, Wow! I do have confidence.
    And I might have even skipped.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
[TK]
[JL1]AU: I set this in italics since the use of present tense here seems to indicate that this is a direct thought, and other direct thoughts in the MS are set in italics. Is this change OK, or would you prefer to keep this passage in roman and change it to past tense instead, to make it part of the narration rather than a direct thought?
[KL2R1]I like how you put this in italics!  
[JL3]AU: I suggested using the subjunctive here and elsewhere in the MS since it’s used a few paragraphs above (“I lumbered back to our spot in line, as if I were Pinocchio right after he came to life”) and in many other places in the MS as well, but please feel free to stet any of these changes if they seem too formal for Becca’s voice!
[JL4]AU: Since Becca spends eight weeks in Vienna (per pp. 14, 15, and 238), and she leaves Vienna on August 17 (per p. 222), she’d have to arrive in Vienna around June 22. Should “July” be changed to “June”?
[KL5R4]I shifted the timeline a bit so July is now correct.
[JL6]AU: I suggested setting this in italics for consistency with other imagined dialogue in the MS (e.g., Come on! you’re probably saying. Everyone knows they’re safe). OK?
[KL7R6]Works for me!
[JL8]AU: I suggested changing this for consistency with “One strand of her hair was out of place” a few paragraphs above (since a lock of hair is composed of more than one strand). OK?
[KL9R8]Yup
[SB10]This feels a bit forced in terms of letting us know what year it is. Can find another way? 
[JL11]AU: Since the following sentence says that both of them ate, should this be changed to “We went to McDonald’s and each got a Quarter Pounder and fries and a Diet Coke[JL11]”? Or “We went to McDonald’s, and I got a Quarter Pounder and fries and a Diet Coke[JL11]”? Or do Becca and her mom share a single burger and Diet Coke?
[KL12R11]Fixed.  I like the idea that Becca and her mom order the same thing.
[JL13]AU: Does Becca’s dad trail off here, or does Becca interrupt him to ask about Nazis? If she interrupts him, could this ellipsis be changed to an em dash for clarity?
[KL14R13]Yes, let’s change to an em dash
[JL15]AU: Should “me” be added here, or should “with” be deleted instead?
[KL16R15]Yes, I added the “me”
[JL17]ED: Since there are 70 instances of ?! in the MS, should any of them be changed to avoid overuse?
[KL18R17] Now there are only 33 
[JL19]AU: Would you like to change this to “I’ll” since Becca’s dad uses contractions in the previous sentence and the next one? 
[KL20R19]Yes, I changed it.
[SB21]Maybe a hint more hesitation here. 
[KL22R21]Added a hint more
[SB23]See next page. 
[KL24R23]fixed
[SB25]Worries? Fears? Can make a bit more kid-like? 
[JL26]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does her mom interrupt her? If her mom interrupts her, could this ellipsis be changed to an em dash for clarity?
[SB27]Is this the best thing to say to someone who suffers from anxiety? Wouldn’t parents have had to have been counseled about how to talk to their daughter with anxiety or is this not where we were yet in 93?
[SB28]Make more kid-like. 
[SB29]Above still sitting. 
[KL30R29]fixed
[SB31]What was trigger for this thought? Had just been thinking about Dad liking it better not having to deal with her worries, so this feels abrupt. 
[KL32R31]She was actually worried about her dad.  Reworded to make that clearer.
[SB33]Funny. But hard to believe she’s not feeling some trepidation. Make sure anxiety attacks comport with situation, not how/where you want them to fall in the plot. 
[JL34]AU:/ED: Should a glossary of German terms be added to the MS? 
[KL35R34]I’m not sure this is necessary.  The German words used should either be understandable by context and/or show Becca’s confusion.  Thoughts Stacey?
[SB36]Breaking fourth wall? Is this done consistently? 
[KL37R36]Nah, I cut
[JL38]AU: Since a few paragraphs below, it sounds as though Becca was worried about just one particular sixth grader, should this be changed to something like “the mean sixth grader”? (See “If I wrote down a bunch of different comeback lines I could use if the mean sixth grader teased me on the bus, I could relax and talk to my friends. (I was a little disappointed she never bothered me after I wrote them down—there were some real zingers!)”)
[KL39R38]Yes, I agree! I changed it.
[SB40]So seven on trip to Chicago? Matches with earlier? Was age mentioned? I’d pictured her as younger. 
[KL41R40]Yes, age was mentioned earlier.  She was seven on the trip to Chicago.
[SB42]This is distracting. Necessary? Meant to show her anxiety? Doesn’t feel like anxiety, only an odd aside. Can tighten? 
[SB43]Okay. Comports with reality? 
[KL44R43]yup
[JL45]AU: I adjusted the tense here because the use of italics seems to indicate that this is intended to be a direct thought, and direct thoughts are generally in present tense (or past tense, rather than past perfect, if the person is thinking about past events, as in the first sentence here). Are these changes OK, or would you prefer to leave the tense as it was and set this passage in roman instead so that it’s part of the narration rather than a direct thought?

I’ve made such adjustments throughout the MS, so if any of them don’t seem right to you, please just let us know!
[KL46R45]This is fine – I like the changes here. 
[JL47]AU: This name was spelled as Katarina 210 times and Katerina only 3 times, so I changed it to the former spelling throughout the MS. OK?
[KL48R47]Yes, Katarina is the correct spelling. 
[SB49]Breaking fourth wall. 
[KL50R49]fixed
[SB51]Maybe, flesh out the one-word answers? It sounds a little disinterested or maybe have Becca react to the one word answers as part of her fear that her dad doesn’t want her there. 
[KL52R51]done
[JL53]AU: I found this a bit confusing, because before Becca started thinking about her phone call with her father, she and her mother were still eating dinner, and now suddenly her mom is reading a book and the flight attendant is passing out blankets. Could something about time passing while Becca was lost in her thoughts be added here?
[KL54R53]Fixed I think
[JL55]AU: It’s unclear whether “there” refers to the galley kitchen, the bathroom, or the aisle between them. Could this be clarified?
[SB56]Too big of a coincidence since Katarina is also a reporter? 
[KL57R56]This is explained later – they actually went to journalism school together.
[JL58]AU: Since it doesn’t seem as though the woman is actually agreeing with anything Becca said, could “agreed” be changed to something like “said” or “replied”? 
[JL59]AU: (global query) There are 97 instances of characters nodding in the MS, often in places where a dialogue tag and/or the addition of “Yes” could work instead. Could some of these instances be changed just to cut down on repetition?
[KL60R59]Done!  Now there are only 45. 
[SB61]Nice. But maybe complete the thought: Sometimes you have to do scary things to get the truth or something that will later be more relevant to Becca? 
[KL62R61]done
[JL63]AU: I suggested setting this in italics for consistency with other unspoken dialogue in the MS (e.g., Yeah, kid, I felt like saying. It’s going to be a long summer). OK?
[KL64R63]Yes, I like this. 
[SB65]Remind us what she looks like. 
[SB66]Most plane crashes happen when a plane is landing. Would this be a fact she’d be aware of? 
[KL67R66]Yup, you’re right!
[JL68]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “watched” here to avoid repetition? Maybe “saw” could work instead?
[KL69R68]Yes, I changed it.
[JL70]AU: (global query) There are 66 instances of “smiled” in the MS, often in places where a dialogue tag could work instead (especially since the word “said” is virtually invisible). Could some of these instances be changed just to cut down on repetition? (I’ve flagged some scenes throughout the MS where there were several instances of characters smiling, but I’d also recommend doing a global search for “smiled” to find other instances you might like to change.)
[KL71R70]I cut out 30 instances so I think it’s much better now.
[JL72]AU: I suggested adding this since “She still had on the silver necklace” appears on page 45. OK?
[KL73R72]Works for me!
[JL74]AU: Since Katarina beams on the previous page as well (“Katarina beamed, as if she thought our introduction had gone extremely well”), would you like to change either instance of “beamed” to avoid repetition?
[KL75R74]Changed it here
[JL76]AU: Should Becca’s mother and Katarina be mentioned here as well? The next sentence indicates that Katarina is still near Sara, and a few paragraphs below, both Becca’s mother and Katarina get in the car with the group, so it seems as though the two women would also be following Becca’s dad at this point. 
[KL77R76]fixed
[SB78]Echoes last use when she hugged her dad or he gave her a huge smile at airport. Make a bit more meaningful here. 
[JL79]AU: Earlier in the MS, she kisses just one finger before pressing it to Becca’s head (“She kissed her finger and, like always, pressed it to the worry crease between my eyebrows”). Should “fingers” be changed to “finger” here?
[KL80R79]I changed it to fingers earlier.
[SB81]Feels a little too on the nose given Becca said the coffee she had tasted like confidence. Can vary here. 
[JL82]AU: Is there a gnome wearing both sunglasses and skis, or is this meant to describe two different gnomes, one wearing sunglasses and the other wearing skis? If one gnome wears both, I’d suggest changing this to “one wearing sunglasses and skis” for clarity. If one gnome wears skis and another wears sunglasses, I’d suggest “one wearing sunglasses, one on skis” instead.
[KL83R82]Fixed!
[SB84]Was there also a dining table or just space for the dining table? 
[KL85R84]Fixed
[JL86]AU: Since Becca’s father was just upstairs with her a few sentences above (“We dumped my bags in the room and went back downstairs”), and there’s no mention of him starting to cook breakfast before they go upstairs, could this be changed to something like “Dad asked as he started to make some oatmeal on the stove[JL86]”?
[KL87R86]Fixed
[SB88]Feels like this is echoing now. Don’t overuse. 
[SB89]Echoes use on prior page. 
[JL90]AU: Should this be changed to “dining table” or just “table”? 
[KL91R90]Just “table” is fine
[JL92]I suggested adding a paragraph break here to separate Becca’s dialogue from Katarina’s actions.
[KL93R92]Fine
[JL94]I suggested adding a paragraph break here to separate Becca’s actions from her dad’s dialogue. 
[KL95R94]Fine
[JL96]AU: I suggested spelling out “Doomsday Journal” here for consistency, since this is one of only two places in the MS where the abbreviation “DJ” is used outside of parenthetical citations. Change OK?
[KL97R96]Fine
[SB98]An article about the economy of food production is on the front page while there’s a war going on? Credible? 
[KL99R98]Yeah, war wasn’t always first page news – even though nearby
[JL100]AU: Since both of these sentences begin with “There was,” could either one be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL101R100]fixed
[SB102]Breaking wall. 
[KL103R102]Fixed I think
[JL104]AU: Since Becca didn’t say anything about taking a walk instead, could “agreed” be changed to “said” or “replied”?
[SB105]Echoes from above. 
[SB106]Use doesn’t feel kid-like here. 
[SB107]Repetitive of “if I hadn’t been so tired”. Not necessary to mention again. Collapsing on the bed shows us. 
[SB108]What day did she arrive on? 
[KL109R108]Sunday morning; I put in a mention of that earlier now
[JL110]AU: Would you like to set this note as a block quotation?
[KL111R110]Yes, that’s a good idea.
[SB112]Show dad. Can’t quite visualize him in this moment. We know he has a beard, but can fill him out with another detail or two? 
[KL113R112]Added another description below
[JL114]AU: Does Becca’s dad trail off here, or does she interrupt him? If she interrupts him, could this ellipsis be changed to an em dash for clarity?
[SB115]Ha! Nice!
[SB116]Was green yesterday, no? Did she redye it? 
[JL117]AU: I changed this per https://dict.leo.org/german-english/Frösche. Is this change OK, or does Sara sometimes make mistakes when speaking German, as she does when she speaks English?
[KL118R117]Thanks for correction! 
[SB119]Maybe add brushing teeth somewhere in here. 😊 
[KL120R119]Done! Good oral hygiene is important 
[JL121]AU: I suggested spelling out “Doomsday Journal” here for consistency, since this is one of only two places in the MS where the abbreviation “DJ” is used outside of parenthetical citations. Change OK?
[KL122R121]Works for me!
[JL123]AU: Since Becca spends eight weeks in Vienna (per pp. 14, 15, and 238), and she leaves Vienna on August 17 (per p. 222), she’d have to arrive in Vienna around June 22, so it seems as though a Monatskarte might not be the most economical choice (unless she can get one that’s good for any 30 days rather than just a certain month). Should this be changed? (Please note that there are other references to Becca’s Monatskarte elsewhere in the MS that would also have to be changed in this case.)
[KL124R123]I adjusted the date slightly. They are buying this now on July 5 – so it’s definitely worth it for the month.
[JL125]I deleted this accent mark per https://dict.leo.org/german-english/Melange and https://en.langenscheidt.com/german-english/melange.  
[KL126R125]Okay, thanks
[JL127]AU: Should this be changed to “oder,” or is Sara speaking half in German, half in English here?
[KL128R127]“oder” is good here
[JL129]AU: Should this be changed to “oder,” or is Sara speaking half in German, half in English here?
[KL130R129]“oder” is good here too
[JL131]AU: I suggested deleting “He trailed off” since this is already implied by the ellipsis. OK?
[KL132R131]Yes, ok to delete
[JL133]AU: Since Ben tells Becca that Sara is nineteen in
