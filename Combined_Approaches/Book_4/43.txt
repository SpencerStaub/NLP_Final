) and one on the previous page as well (“We smiled at each other”), could any of these instances be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL228R227]fixed
[JL229]AU: Could this be changed to “said”?
[SB230]She didn’t say convoy. 
[SB231]So she has been in contact with them since she left? Seemed she hadn’t been. 
[KL232R231]fixed
[SB233]Can recast? Feels a bit adult. 
[KL234R233]fixed
[JL235]AU: Should “go” be added here?
[KL236R235]Yes, added
[JL237]AU: I suggested using numerals for all numbers in this list for consistency with the same list on pages 131 and 154 and since it doesn’t seem as though Becca would actually write “Number one,” etc. Changes OK?
[KL238R237]Yes, that makes sense to me!
[JL239]AU: I moved this after “I wrote” just to avoid starting a sentence with a numeral (I made similar changes to #3 and #4 a few paragraphs below). OK? 
[KL240R239]Yup
[JL241]AU: I suggested deleting the quotation marks here and around the other items Becca adds to this list below for consistency with other handwritten text in the MS, which is set in italics without quotation marks (e.g., “In my careful, neat handwriting I wrote down, Number one: Eat a soft-boiled egg” and “In neat block letters she had written, Ich suche Petra Tahirović, 44, und Eldin Tahirović, 6.”). But if the quotation marks are meant to convey that she says this aloud as well as writing it down, I’d suggest keeping the quotation marks, changing “I wrote” to “I said,” and setting it in roman instead. 
[KL242R241]I think the way you did it works well
[JL243]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does Sara interrupt her? If Sara interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[JL244]AU: I deleted “of people” here for consistency with the same list on pp. 131 and 154. Is this change OK, or should “of people” be added on pp. 131 and 154 instead?
[KL245R244]Yes, this is fine. 
[SB246]A tad melodramatic. 
[SB247]See comment on p. 108.
[KL248R247]Fixed comment below
[SB249]Can show Dad in this moment? Can’t really see him. 
[KL250R249]Added a bit of description
[SB251]Does this mean that there weren’t a lot of people who were able to immigrate so they could afford to be accommodating to those who did try and get through? Say a bit more plainly. 
[JL252]AU: Should this be changed to “residence permits” (the more common term), or should it be left as is since this is dialogue?
[KL253R252]changed
[SB254]From highlights above, seems she knows he does know that, so slightly confused by what she’s saying here. 
[JL255]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does Sara interrupt her? If Sara interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[SB256]This is third mention. Maybe cut second above. 
[KL257R256]Changed to speckled above
[SB258]Avoid rep/ 
[KL259R258]Fixed
[JL260]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “cold” here to avoid repetition? 
[KL261R260]fixed
[SB262]Why doesn’t he think they like him? Wouldn’t Becca or Sara ask? 
[KL263R262]done
[JL264]AU: Could either “communal” or “to share” be deleted to avoid redundancy?
[KL265R264]fixed
[SB266]Threw? Don’t quite understand shoving it under the table unless there are other things under the table the book is being shoved into. 
[JL267]AU: Since “mumbled” is used as a dialogue tag a few paragraphs above as well (“You already know their names,” he mumbled), could either instance of it be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL268R267]Fixed
[SB269]When had he been told about her previously? Never cleared up. 
[KL270R269]Fixed earlier
[SB271]Was Felix participating in the conversation? Unclear. 
[SB272]Is her father present? No mention of him at party above. 
[JL273]AU: I suggested changing this just so it can’t read as though Felix wished Becca would look around the room. OK?
[KL274R273]Works for me
[SB275]This doesn’t really track. Felix said he didn’t know them well and he was right about that and they all looked happy for him? How do these thoughts connect? Clarify. 
[SB276]Really need to make more mention of him at the outset of the scene. Hadn’t seemed like he was present/ 
[KL277R276]I mentioned him a couple of times now.
[JL278]AU: I made this plural for consistency with “I could see gold hoop earrings peeking out from her shoulder-length hair” on p. 26. OK?
[KL279R278]Yup
[JL280]AU: I found this a bit confusing, because “‘Wait, you said you were going to visit your father. Is he that nice American man Katarina has been dating?’ She pointed to my father” a few paragraphs above gave me the impression that Ms. Madden and Becca’s dad had already met, and since Becca, her dad, Katarina, and Ms. Madden seem to be the only people present for the following conversation, it doesn’t seem as though anyone would need to be introduced. Should “there were introductions all around[JL280]” be changed?
[SB281]This is Hester speaking, right? Not sure where in time we are, but below she says she’s headed back to Sarajevo in the next day or two. Does that work if she’s also going to the vigil? 
[KL282R281]I fixed below
[JL283]AU: Does Ben trail off here, or does Becca interrupt him? If she interrupts him, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[JL284]AU: Should this be changed to the technically correct “whoever,” which might be a better fit for Hester’s voice?
[KL285R284]Yes, fixed
[SB286]She has a good memory for names and spellings, no? Almost too good to be believed? Maybe she could have previously written the names down in her Doomsday Journal? 
[KL287R286]fixed
[SB288]A mite adult.
[JL289]AU: Since “Mai squealed” follows a question mark and an exclamation point rather than a comma, it’s unclear whether it’s meant to be a dialogue tag or a separate sentence/action. If it’s meant to be a dialogue tag, could it be changed to “squealed Mai” for clarity? 
[SB290]Really? I know these are smart kids, but this feels like a real stretch. Can make a bit more kid-nerdy like some long fantasy novel or some such? 
[SB291]This all feels like a VERY big coincidence. Sort of feel about the kid interest in ballroom dancing as I do about the interest in Ken Burns…Anyway to recast this for credibility. 
[KL292R291]Reworked this scene
[JL293]AU: When Becca, Felix, and Sara run into Marco at McDonald’s on p. 62 and Marco mentions the dance studio, he doesn’t say that he’s a teaching assistant or even that he works at the studio, so it doesn’t seem as though Becca could know this. Here’s the relevant passage:

“I dance too. My neighbor owns a dance studio. She’s Hungarian.” He handed Sara the postcard. “We need a new assistant teacher for the teen ballroom class.”

Should Becca’s dialogue here be changed, or should Marco’s dialogue on p. 62 be changed instead so that he specifically mentions that he’s one of the teaching assistants for the teen ballroom class? 
(Please see my query about the sentence “Apparently, the female teaching assistant had come down with Windpocken (chicken pox), and so he asked Sara to reconsider[JL293]” on p. 159 as well, as that may also affect any revisions you decide to make to the McDonald’s scene.) 
[KL294R293]fixed
[JL295]I suggested splitting this passage up into multiple paragraphs to separate each character’s dialogue/actions from the others’. 
[KL296R295]Works for me
[JL297]AU: Since as far as readers know, Sara never actually said no (only “maybe”) to Marco’s offer to be a teaching assistant for this class (per the conversation they have at McDonald’s on p. 62), it seems as though she could still be considering taking the position and therefore wouldn’t need to be signed up for the class as a student. Should “all three of you” be changed to “both of you”? 
[KL298R297]changed
[SB299]Note, Becca’s dad still feels very missing from these scenes. 
[KL300R299]Hopefully fixed
[JL301]AU: I set this in italics for consistency with the mouthed dialogue on p. 118 (“She mouthed Help him and pointed to Felix”). OK?
[KL302R301]Yup
[SB303]Maybe show his facial expression and/or have him say a little more to earn Becca’s thought on the next line. Really alone doesn’t do it. 
[SB304]Echoes use with Felix above. Not necessary here. 
[JL305]AU: Should “all” be changed to “both” if Sara is still considering being a teaching assistant for the class at this point? (Please see my query about “all three of you” on the previous page for more details.)
[KL306R305]fixed
[JL307]AU: I added this dialogue tag to clarify that Becca says this—is that right?
[KL308R307]Yes
[SB309]Phrasing here feels a mite adult. 
[SB310]Can cut down on its here? 
[JL311]I suggested adding a paragraph break here to separate Felix’s actions from Becca’s dialogue. 
[KL312R311]Works for me
[SB313]Boat gambling? What is this? Is this referring to casinos on boats or do people gamble boats? 
[JL314]AU: Since Sara nods four times on this page, could any of these instances be changed to avoid repetition?
[SB315]Chuckle. 
[JL316]AU: I changed this for consistency with “I was quiet as we took it partway across town and then switched back to streetcar 38” on p. 72. OK?
[KL317R316]Yup works for me
[JL318]AU: Is there something missing after “busy”? Or should “busy” be changed to something else?
[KL319R318]Fixed 
[JL320]AU: I edited this because the original sentence required a plural verb, but “There were” could sound awkward before “a restaurant in the middle[JL320].” OK?
[KL321R320]OK. I edited the next sentence to avoid repeating “There were”
[JL322]AU: Do you mean “soft” in the sense of “not bright” or “smooth in texture”? If you mean “not bright,” I’d suggest adding a hyphen here for clarity: “a soft-blue one.” If you mean “smooth in texture,” I’d suggest deleting “soft” instead (since according to the first sentence in this paragraph, all the scarves were soft: “the scarves were pretty, all super thin and soft, like silk”). 
[KL323R322]Fixed
[JL324]AU: Since Felix says “It’s barely five” in the previous sentence, should “nineteen thirty” be changed to “seven thirty”? Or should “five” be changed to “seventeen” instead? Considering how good Felix’s English is, it seems as though “five” and “seven thirty” might make more sense here. 
[JL325]AU: I suggested adding “as if” here since the MS is written from Becca’s point of view and she can’t know for sure that the woman was pretending she hadn’t been listening to their conversation—she can only guess. OK?
[KL326R325]ok
[JL327]AU: I suggested adding “young” here to match the description of this woman on the next page (“The young woman conducted to herself”). OK?
[KL328R327]Fine
[JL329]AU: I suggested changing this since MW defines “shake one’s head” as “to turn one's head from side to side as a way of answering "no" or of showing disagreement or refusal” (meaning one can’t really shake their head yes). OK?
[JL330]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “big” here to avoid repetition?
[KL331R330]Fixed
[JL332]AU: Could “school” be added here for clarity (since “The corridor looked just like a hallway at school” appears on p. 139)?
[KL333R332]added
[SB334]Patrons? 
[JL335]AU: I suggested deleting “gilded” here to avoid repetition, since it appears earlier in this sentence as well. OK?
[KL336R335]Fine
[JL337]I added a paragraph break here to separate Becca’s actions from Felix’s dialogue. 
[KL338R337]Fine
[JL339]AU: Do you mean “soft” in the sense of “not bright” or “smooth in texture”? If you mean “not bright,” I’d suggest adding a hyphen here for clarity: “the soft-blue fabric.”
[KL340R339]fixed
[JL341]AU: Does this refer to Becca’s scarf or to her dress? Since both are blue, could either “of my scarf” or “of my dress” be added after “fabric” for clarity?
[KL342R341]Fixed 
[SB343]Lovely. 
[JL344]AU: On p. 94, Sara’s exact words are “listen to the mystery and beauty in the world.” Should “listen to the universe[JL344]” be changed to match?
[KL345R344]Fixed earlier so it matched better
[JL346]AU: Is this change OK? I’m guessing this is a typo since according to page 32, Katarina “spoke near-perfect English,” but please just let us know if that isn’t the case!
[KL347R346]Yes, it’s fine.
[SB348]Very emotional moment. 
[KL349R348]☺ 
[SB350]Really nice tension. 
[JL351]AU: Should this be changed to a Bosnian greeting rather than a German one? Unfortunately I didn’t have any luck finding a reputable-looking Bosnian-English dictionary online, but for what it’s worth, Google Translate suggests “halo” (with one l) or “zdravo” for “hello”: https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=bs&text=hello. This dictionary lists “zdravo” as well: http://ba.rjecnik.com/logindict.cgi. 
[KL352R351]I say let’s go with “halo.”
[JL353]AU: I suggested adding “as if” here since the MS is written from Becca’s point of view and she can’t know for sure what her dad and Katarina are feeling—she can only guess. OK?
[JL354]AU: Should this line break be deleted, since there isn’t really a scene change here, or should it be formatted like the other section breaks in the MS instead?
[KL355R354]deleted
[JL356]AU: I edited this line to match the lyrics from the original song (per this clip from the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnBMAEA3AM). OK?
[KL357R356]OK
[JL358]AU: Since up until this point, Becca hears the lyrics in her head but doesn’t actually sing aloud (and since below she tells Felix and Sara “Today, I was singing a song in my head as I rode”), should this be changed to something like “but as I heard the song in my head” or “but as the lyrics ran through my head” for clarity?
[KL359R358]I want her to sing them out loud this time.
[JL360]AU: Since earlier in this scene, Becca hears the lyrics in her head but doesn’t actually sing aloud (and since below she tells Felix and Sara “Today, I was singing a song in my head as I rode”), should “singing” be deleted here for clarity?
[KL361R360]She should sing out loud.
[SB362]Echoes from use with dad after opera. Phrasing itself is a mit awkward. 
[JL363]AU: I suggested changing this dialogue tag to avoid repetition, since “added” appears as a dialogue tag in the previous paragraph as well. OK?
[KL364R363]I fixed it.
[JL365]AU: Does Sara trail off here, or does Felix interrupt her? If he interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash to clarify that.
[SB366]Chocolate and ginger ale? My teeth hurt just thinking about that. lol
[KL367R366]haha
[JL368]AU: Should something like “in my head” be added after this for clarity?
[KL369R368]fixed
[JL370]AU: I found this confusing at first, since it’s only Thursday at this point in the story and the dance class isn’t until Friday, and it’s not immediately clear that they were planning to ride to the studio just so Becca could practice riding her bike there. Could this be changed to something like “The next morning, Sara, Felix, and I were planning to ride to the dance studio[JL370] just so I could get a feel for the route before the class on Friday, but when we woke up, it was raining” for clarity?
[KL371R370]fixed
      [JL372]AU: When Marco mentions the dance class to Sara at McDonald’s, he says there’s already a need for a new assistant teacher, but “Apparently, the female teaching assistant had come down with Windpocken (chicken pox), and so he asked Sara to reconsider[JL372]” makes it sound as though the TA just came down with chicken pox. 
[KL373R372]Fixed this problem
[JL374]AU: I changed this to match the description of DJ #1 on p. 20: “a hot-pink diary with a unicorn and rhinestones on the front.” OK?
[KL375R374]Yup
[JL376]AU: Would you like to change this to “I’ve” since Becca uses contractions when she speaks elsewhere in the MS?
[SB377R376]Agree. 
[KL378R376]Fixed
[JL379]AU: I suggested adding this and inserting quotes around “They are trying to make me eat raw eggs…” to clarify that Becca says this aloud, rather than just showing the journal entry to Felix so he can read it himself (since she tells Felix to “listen” at the beginning of this paragraph). OK?
[KL380R379]Fine
[JL381]AU: I suggested changing this ellipsis to an em dash because it seems as though Felix interrupts Becca before she can finish this sentence (rather than Becca just trailing off). OK?
[KL382R381]Yup, works for me
[SB383]Avoid rep. 
[JL384]AU: I suggested deleting “of one” to avoid repetition, since “One” appears at the beginning of the next sentence as well. OK?
[KL385R384]Yup
[JL386]AU: Since the words “cute,” “little,” and “pig” are all used multiple times in this passage, could “A cute little pig” be deleted to avoid repetition? (So it would just read “a little curly tail. It was a pig! I didn’t know I could draw such a cute little pig.[JL386]”)
[KL387R386]Fixed 
[JL388]AU: Could “a big deal” be added to the end of this sentence (so it can’t read as “Maybe it wasn’t really unique” or “Maybe it wasn’t an amazing thought” instead)? 
[KL389R388]Fixed
[SB390]Would be nice to see Felix in this moment. Haven’t been reminded of what he looks like in a while, right? 
[JL391]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “trash” here to avoid repetition?
[KL392R391]Done
[SB393]Word choice echoing. 
[SB394]Tighten. A mite clunky. 
[KL395R394]done
[SB396]Echoes Becca’s use of g gesture earlier. Maybe change earlier “generous gesture” as the alliteration does read a mite awkwardly. 
[JL397]AU: I suggested deleting “dance” here just to avoid repetition, since “dance” appears again later in the sentence. OK?
[KL398R397]Yup
[JL399]I added a paragraph break here to separate Felix’s and Becca’s actions from Mai’s dialogue.
[KL400R399]OK
[JL401]I changed this per https://en.langenscheidt.com/german-english/willkommen#Willkommen. 
[KL402R401]Ok 
[JL403]AU: Since “Daisy squealed” follows a question mark and an exclamation point rather than a comma, it’s unclear whether it’s meant to be a dialogue tag or a separate sentence/action. If it’s meant to be a dialogue tag, could it be changed to “squealed Daisy” for clarity?
[KL404R403]Fixed
[JL405]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “colorful” here to avoid repetition?
[KL406R405]Done
[JL407]AU: Since Felix and Peter get the same thing, meaning they don’t each get something different, could this be changed to something like “We each ordered something different, except Felix and Peter, who both got the Schoko-Lovers sundae. Daisy ordered the Hawaiian—pineapple gelato, vanilla sauce, and pistachios”?
[KL408R407]I just deleted the “different” part.
[SB409]Okay, but could let us know before she starts this exchange. 
[SB410]Isn’t Sara sitting at the same table? Wouldn’t she hear Becca?
[KL411R410]fixed
[JL412]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does Rasheed interrupt her? If he interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[SB413]Okay, but could let us know before she starts this exchange. 
[JL414]AU: I edited this to avoid repeating “weekend” and to clarify that the trip actually takes place the last weekend in July, since the candlelight vigil, which happens a week after the trip, is scheduled for the first weekend in August, per p. 121 (the original sentence reads as though he made the announcement the last weekend in July, but it’s not clear whether the trip took place that weekend as well). Edits OK?
[KL415R414]Timeline changed
[JL416]AU: Would you like to change either instance of “handed over” here to avoid repetition?
[KL417R416]fixed
[JL418]AU: Since Katarina speaks “near-perfect English,” should this be changed to “fluctuate”?
[KL419R418]Yes, I fixed
[JL420]AU: Could either instance of “pulled” here be changed to avoid repetition? Maybe to “took”?
[SB421R420]Yes, avoid rep. 
[KL422R420]Fixed
[JL423]AU: Since muesli and granola aren’t exactly the same, could this be changed to something like “muesli (which was like granola)”? See https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-muesli-and-granola-239292 and https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/muesli-vs-granola. 
[KL424R423]Works for me
[JL425]AU: Since the skeleton is actually visible all the time (it doesn’t actually pop out of a window, though it does ring a bell every hour on the hour), should this be changed? 

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ouo3ebK7Zxo. 
[KL426R425]Fixed
[JL427]AU: Could this be changed to something like “As the clock chimed nine, a bunch of apostle figurines paraded by these windows, and the skeleton rang a bell”? (Please see link in my previous query.)
[KL428R427]fixed
[JL429]AU: Could this be changed to either “Schönbrunn’s buildings” or “Prague Castle’s buildings” for clarity?
[KL430R429]Hopefully I fixed and made it clearer
[JL431]AU: Should this be changed to “worn”?
[JL432]I capitalized this since it’s the official name of the cemetery, per https://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/explore/sites/old-jewish-cemetery/. 
[KL433R432]Thanks
[JL434]AU: Since Katarina doesn’t typically lapse into German when she’s speaking to Becca, should this be changed to “House”?
[JL435]AU: Since some people view this term as a slur, it might be worth considering avoiding it, even in dialogue from decades ago. What do you think?
[SB436]Doesn’t she? It would be a big crowd, right? 
[JL437]AU: Would you like to change either “believer” or “believed” here to avoid repetition?
[KL438R437]fixed
[JL439]AU: I suggested changing this so it doesn’t read as though Sara had this dream while sleeping on the bridge. OK? 
[KL440R439]Thanks, works for me!
[JL441]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does her dad interrupt her? If he interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[KL442R441]fixed
[SB443]Show dad in this moment. 
[JL444]AU: Since contractions appear elsewhere in his dialogue, should this be changed to “So you’re right—sometimes I’m upset, but it’s never at you”?
[KL445R444]Leave “am” because Dad is emphasizing that
[JL446]AU: I edited this passage to avoid repetition, since there were three instances of “ticket” here. OK?
[KL447R446]Works for me!
[SB448]Already mentioned above that purse is green. 
[JL449]AU: Since there’s no mention of Becca being careful when she opens the door the first time (“I had just opened the door between the cars, when a small child of five or six came barreling through the passageway and ran right into me”), could “even” be deleted?
[JL450]AU: Could this be changed “the conductor” for clarity?
[JL451]AU: Does Becca trail off here, or does the woman interrupt her? If the woman interrupts her, I’d suggest changing this ellipsis to an em dash for clarity.
[JL452]AU: Since “stopping” appears in the previous sentence, could “stopped and” be deleted here to avoid repetition?
[KL453R452]Fixed 
[JL454]AU: According to page 185, Becca, not Sara, was holding the soda when the boy ran into them (per “The sodas came in glass bottles. I watched as the saleswoman popped off the bottle caps before handing them carefully to me. Sara paid with money from my dad’s envelope and put the change back into her green purse. Then she picked up her coffee”). Should this be changed to “When the little boy ran into me, I spilled the soda on this woman’s table”?
[KL455R454]Fixed
[JL456]AU: Since “demanded” is used as a dialogue tag a few paragraphs above (“What did she say?” I demanded) and later on this page as well (“But what happened to her passport?!” I demanded), could any of these instances be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL457R456]fixed
[JL458]AU: Could either “sneak” or “sneaking” be changed here to avoid repetition?
[KL459R458]fixed
[JL460]AU: I set this in roman and enclosed it in quotation marks to clarify that Felix is quoting Sara’s dialogue here (otherwise it could seem as though the italics are just for emphasis). OK?
[KL461R460]Works for me!
[JL462]AU: Since “Felix wailed” appears at the end of the previous page as well (“Becca, what are we going to do?!” Felix wailed), could either instance of it be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL463R462]Cut above
[JL464]AU: Since “rummaged” appears a few paragraphs above as well (“I nodded, rummaged in my backpack again”), could either instance be changed to avoid repetition?
[JL465]AU: Since Sara’s coffee is described as “lukewarm” on the previous page (“It was only lukewarm now, but the coffee was familiar and bitter”), could “cold coffee” be changed to something like “cooling coffee”?
[KL466R465]Just coffee is fine
[SB467]Can vary this last way and the next one? 
[SB468]Can tighten? A mite clunky. 
[JL469]AU: Does Becca put the purse inside Sara’s backpack or her own? Could this be clarified?
[SB470]To avoid rep of backpack.
[JL471]I suggested adding a paragraph break here to separate Becca’s actions from the secretary’s dialogue. 
[KL472R471]Works for me!
[SB473]Neat and tidy are synonyms. Cut one or the other. 
[KL474R473]Done
[JL475]AU: I edited this to clarify that the furniture, not the house itself, was old but in excellent shape (since according to p. 48, the house itself isn’t old: “Some of the houses were in new developments, like where my father lived, but others were crumbling, as if they were hundreds of years old”). OK?
[KL476R475]Yup, thanks
[JL477]AU: Since Frau Kumar also shakes her head a few paragraphs above, could either instance of this be changed to avoid repetition?
[KL478R477]fixed
[JL479]AU: I found this a bit confusing, because “No one was hungry for dinner” gave me the impression that they skipped dinner altogether, but the fact that Becca is doing the dishes seems to indicate that they did have dinner. If they do make dinner but no one eats much, could “No one was hungry for dinner” be changed to something like “No one ate much at dinner”? 
[KL480R479]fixed
