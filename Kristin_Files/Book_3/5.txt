[CE23]Okay? I think “angel food” and “cake” can’t really be separated in this way
[CE24]Okay, to clarify that she’s talking about the fire, rather than reminding him to change his boots?
[CE25]Okay? As above
[CE26]Okay? There’s no referent for “it”
[CE27]No need to mention the box again, I don’t think?
[CE28]They recycle newspapers but not other papers—okay?
[CE29]Predominant style throughout for imagined speech is ital. 
[SB30]Stacey not so concerned about this point. Really nice scene that Kristin has set up. Can remain as-is. 
[CE31]Okay? As above.

[SB44]Not really thinking realistically that it wouldn’t come up. Maybe an opportunity to show Tommy as a bully and tell Little Skinny/Sam not to rat him out or else? Also reads too obviously that it would definitely come up. Finesse a bit. 
[CE45]I don’t have a reliable means of checking the Polish spelling; au, please check and confirm.
[CE46]Okay? By now it would be 15 …

[CE50]Okay?
[CE51]Okay? Is there where the narrator’s speech ends? If not, please clarify that this is someone else speaking or Tommy thinking.

[SB56]Had Eddie known before this? No one called his parents? Or did Little Skinny not also see Eddie with yo-yo? Make sure Eddie hadn’t also played with yo-yo in sight of Little Skinny/Sam.
[SB57]How did Tommy feel about that? About not getting to see Mary Lou?
[CE58]http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/176321
[SB59]So Skinny only told about Tommy, not Eddie? Clarify earlier that Eddie wasn’t playing with the yo-yo Tommy gave him when they got back to school, so Little Skinny hadn’t seen. 
[CE60]okay? to show change? just a minute ago he spoke in a big booming voice …

[CE62]So, fishing at this time of year okay, then? Please just confirm. (late September)
[CE63]However, I could not confirm that a record of his music was out in 1953; please confirm.
[CE64]Please confirm these quotes; I couldn’t find them online
[CE65]Please confirm this quote
[SB66]Maybe relate back to first convo with Mary Lou for full credibility in thinking this. 
[CE67]could cut this
[SB68]And to really earn this, Tommy needs to see something specifically happen to McKenzie or his store a beat earlier. Maybe on his way home from Tivoli after seeing movies. 
[SB69]But by now, had a week or slow days, right? Clarify, it’s not just today. 
[CE70]Might he add here when they moved to the U.S. and how that affected (or didn’t) his wife’s health?
[CE71]Clarify that this is the closed front door of the shop? Would they hear it way back in the office/back room?
[SB72]Tommy needs to intentionally contemplate what it means to tell Officer Russo. Surely, Tommy knows that’s what McKenzie’s phone call was about. Also don’t lose the thread of having told Office Russo later. This detail feels a little forgotten about later. 
[SB73]Who? Not mentioned before. 
[CE74]Would Officer Russo ask Tommy where he got the paper?
[CE75]“pay no more heed” or “give no more credence/credibility”
[CE76]This makes it seem like maybe a Tuesday or Wednesday (it was just Saturday)—see later query about what day it is the day after this day

[CE85]Busia played a Scottish tune on New Year’s Eve? No reason why not, but just double-checking since there are so many references to her really sticking to Polish traditions; maybe the song/poem had become part of Polish traditions as well?
[SB86]By this point wondering when was the last time Tommy had worried for Mary Lou? Need a memory of her or thinking of her being burned to keep that thread consistent. 
[CE87]Oct. 11, by my calculations—see style sheet; so it’s been October for more than a week; he might say something more like “It was well into October now”?  Or stet because exact timeline not crucial here …?
[CE88]usual style would have this closed up as one word, but it does look a little odd this way; maybe stet the hyphen or recast as: “and three bare wooden chairs” or “and three plain, hard chairs” 
[CE89]I did not confirm this Russian word
[SB90]Show a bit more of Mrs. G here. Can’t quite see her face. Nice moment to see her here. 
[CE91]Okay? Healed that much after only 3 weeks?
[SB92]Earned? His sense of worry can be heightened up until this point to earn. 
[CE93]NB
[SB94]Earned yet? Maybe have Tommy remember something that happened here that does earn the comment? Especially as we’re led to believe Mom’s behavior is recent as of Susie’s birth and Busia’s death. 
[CE95]I can’t tell if this has already been style to be set as EXT; if not, please do note for EXT.
[SB96]Is this true? Feels like we’ve lost track of this. 
[CE97]phrase these as things he might say directly to her, but with question marks because he’s asking himself at the same time as hypothesizing them
[CE98]Okay? he hasn’t told Mary Lou this yet, I don’t think
[CE99]Spelling not confirmed
[CE100]http://www.frankielaine.com/
[CE101]I can’t tell if this has been set EXT, but if not, might consider it
[CE102]Authentic for early 1950s? Seems that maybe “shoot” or “darn” or “gee” or even just “oops” or “uh-oh” might be more likely? 
[CE103]Okay? earlier the sign says “closed for lunch”
[CE104]But the reeds would all be dead and the bushes leafless at this time of year, yes?
[CE105]Would they be biting in November, though? Do they not sort of hibernate in the mud at the bottom of a pond in the cold weather? I’m no expert at fishing, though, so just disregard if this query is off-base.
[SB106]Repetitive mention. Also didn’t talk much in the car. 
[SB107]Need more active thinking what it would mean to turn her in?
[SB108]Need more in his reasoning to tell. He tells/confesses in this way a few times throughout and feels repetitive and too easy. 
[CE109]http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/21/us/21radulovich.html
[SB110]Repetitive of line above it. 
[CE111]It’s so funny/poignant (so Cold War–era) how Tommy actually thinks this! ☺ Just great. 
[CE112]Okay? see earlier query about fishing in late Nov.
[SB113]Show him worried about this earlier at least once before this moment and separate from seeing bill initially. 
[CE114]I don’t think Eddie has spoken in this kind of ungrammatical way before; okay? or change to “anyone”?
[SB115]We need this in actual scene before to earn this. Otherwise feels thrown in. Reader had no sense of Tommy getting paid before. 
[CE116]vary?

http://www.economist.com/node/10205214 (program aired on Oct. 20, so, yes, a little over a month ago –it’s about Nov. 30 now)

However, I could not confirm this as the exact date of his reinstatement—both because the sources I checked don’t note the exact date and because this point in the your story isn’t noted with an exact date; okay? so long as the reinstatement was around Nov. 30/Dec. 1, 1953, this is fine.
[CE119]http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/398337/Edward-R-Murrow
[CE120]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211168/
[CE121]this sounds too old for a 12-year-old; would Tommy not think something more like: He looked like he could have been anyone’s dad, right here in Downers Grove/? (The dads of Tommy and his friends would likely all have been about 35 at this point, yes?) Radulovich was 27 in 1953—to a 12-yr-old he’d look like a grown-up, not “anyone’s son” which for Tommy would mean himself, Eddie, etc.
[SB122]Context of statement here unclear. Also, this scene isn’t yet as compelling as it needs to feel. Feels mostly like an info dump that’s not feeling seamless or organic. All of a sudden it feels like the narrative has stopped to give us a lesson on Edward R. Murrow. Show family watching See It Now before this moment, so this doesn’t feel specifically to impart this information. Also use this as an opportunity to make communism feel scary to a kid. This currently feels far too cerebral and the kid reader won’t walk away really understanding or scared, but more confused and likely to gloss over details. 
[CE123]Murrow quote not confirmed
[CE124]seems about right for a can of paint: http://www.ask.com/question/how-much-did-things-cost-in-1953

Also, there’s this: http://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/hark-the-herald-angels-sing?lang=eng
[SB131]Really established in a way that would resonate yet? Heighten this earlier. Feels like we don’t really know yet that Sam’s mom isn’t going to make it. Don’t foreshadow it too much. Takes away poignancy and stunned surprise when she does go. 
[CE132]vary?
[SB133]When is the last time he’s seen her at this point? Timeline a little muddy.

[SB147]Description of beating is too matter of fact. That’s it. All descriptions too matter of fact. Make them more emotional. Panicked. 
[SB148]Was Tommy winded? Clarify his emotional and physical response. 
[CE149]used above; vary here?
[SB150]Stage directions feeling a little monotone and repetitive of form. See highlights as well. 
[CE151]Okay? Not much earlier on this same morning, heavy fluffy snow has been falling—turned to slush already?
[SB152]Good tension. This is emotion we need earlier through all beatings as well. 
[CE153]Great scene!
[SB154]Repetitive. Comes out the same way each time he decides to unburden himself. Not making unburdening himself feel special or like it’s particularly difficult for him. 
[CE155]Aww. ☺
[CE156]So good.
[SB157]Very poignant. 
[CE158]☺
[SB159]Very good scene. 
[CE160]okay to add? or “traumatic” or “emotional”

[CE164]to avoid rep.
[CE165]You might laugh, but I’ve noticed there are a lot of sausages in this story (the Kopeckys especially); maybe have her cooking something else, just for variety? Bacon or pork chops? Or meat loaf?
[SB166]How long since fight with Eddie? No real concern about them getting kicked out of school over fighting. 
[SB167]How long do they take to decide this? It’s been a while since fight, no? Doesn’t seem to be a pressing concern or a decision that’s imminent? Why? 
[SB168]Tommy already knew this. Mentioned earlier. 
[CE169]Okay? Use “but” to show the opposition
[CE170]Checked: http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1954&country=1
[CE171]There was absolutely no indication that this is what Tommy was worrying about … seems out of left field. Also, Dad (especially in the 1950s) wouldn’t be talking to kid about hospital bills, would he? I know he’s mentioned it once or twice, but it seems odd here.

And the next line seems a bit overly intuitive again. Maybe after Tommy shrugs, Dad might just say “Don’t worry, things are looking up” and then Tommy would think that seemed unlikely, or notice something a bit simpler, like Dad isn’t smiling when he says it, or that the lines on Dad’s forehead seems deeper  or -- ?
[SB172]The answer to this is to heighten worry about medical bills throughout. Line clearly shows Dad’s worried about it and thinking that’s what’s bothering Tommy because that’s what’s bothering him. Also, indication that Dad is still out of touch.

[SB177]How long did it take to decide this? Why so long? Need a credible reason. 
[CE178]http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/k/karl_marx.html
[CE179]might he add something brief, though, about the distinction between having ideas and hate speech or the kind of “freedom of expression” that resulted in Mr. McKenzie’s windows and car being defaced? It would be important to make that distinction for a young boy like his son
[CE180]This is really nice—nicely put.
[SB181]Maybe previously only tell other people he confided in bits and pieces of the story and tell Mary Lou everything to distinguish between the many times Tommy confides in people. 
[CE182]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/
[SB183]The idea of Dad refusing charity needs to be brought up earlier (when Pa/Ma et offer help) to make this feel organic. Let the reason Dad refuses at first be about charity. 
[CE184]NB
[SB185]Is this the day after? How much time has passed between last visit and now? Timeline is muddy? 
[SB186]Nice! 
[CE187]It was last night that they talked, so she wouldn’t have been smiling the whole time… recast?
[SB188]How long did it take to decide this? Why so long? Need a credible reason. 
[SB189]When was this scheduled to happen? 
[CE190]Surely it’s February by now; please review timeline on the style sheet and confirm or make any changes needed
[CE191]Stet caps here
[SB192]Nice emotion. 
[SB193]Nice! 
[CE194]Where is this and when? A meeting held … at Mrs. Glazov’s house? Somewhere in town? In the evening or on a weekend?
[CE195]My ancient King James Version Bible has the word “iniquity” here, but I would imagine there are lots of versions with slightly different wording; please just confirm it’s okay as is
[SB196]Nice!
[SB197]Have this be tied to previous refusals of Dad when people offered to help/ 
[CE198]Seems about right, and would put us around mid-Feb.
[CE199]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/
[SB200]Have dad say something about how he can see it’s very important to Tommy and he’s proud of Tommy so the okay feels more hard-won. 
[SB201]Nice! 
[CE202]Okay?
[SB203]Nice! 
[SB204]Just appears in narrative. No prior sense that this really happened. She made pumpkin pies and Tommy took two pieces to eat with his sister, but not other sense Mom did something so nice. Seems Tommy would have made note. Maybe it could be something she does the same day as going to traffic court to show how she can go from 0 to 60? 
[SB205]Have Dad admit it would be hard to send mom away b.c he loves her. Make this a hint more poignant and show him at cross purposes even though he’s resolved for the good of his children to them first if Mom doesn’t get better. 
[CE206]if changed earlier, change here too
[SB207]I think sausages is fine. This is a community of Eastern European immigrants. Seems like a shared loved of sausages is perfectly fine and accurate.  
[SB208]Show Pa’s face/expression in this moment. 
[SB209]Nice!
[CE210]how does Tommy know this is who they are?
[CE211]http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/178884.Edward_R_Murrow

quote confirmed, but I did not confirm that Murrow said this on TV on Tues., March 9, 1954
[SB212]Nice! 
[CE213]These two lines don’t match up with the source I used, but I imagine there are numerous sources with slight variations; please check against the source you used, and just make sure these lines are okay as they are

http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/28/ballad_of_high_noon/
[SB214]LOL ☺
[SB215]Nice! This theme still needs more consistent development throughout to work. As it stands now, develops too late in the narrative. 
[CE216]This sounds very similar to what he says when Dad apologizes. Okay? Vary?
