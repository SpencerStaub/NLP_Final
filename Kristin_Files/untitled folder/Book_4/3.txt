The Doomsday Journal
At the door to the airplane, a woman in a red dress with white trim and matching heels smiled at us. “Grüß Gott![JL34][KL35]” she exclaimed cheerily. “Welcome to Austrian Airlines.” She looked a bit like Little Red Riding Hood, minus the cape. Mom beamed at her and we stepped onto the plane.
    The Benadryl had started to kick in, and I felt a little woozy. I didn’t remember planes being quite so big. There were two aisles, the seats arranged in a two-five-two configuration. We had seats 22A and 22B, but we picked the wrong aisle to walk down, so we had to continue to a little galley kitchen, then cross over to the other side. Finally, we reached our seats.
    “Do you want the aisle or the window?” Mom asked.
    “The window.” Dr. Teresa had suggested that since I wasn’t scared of heights, maybe being able to see the ground would make me feel a little bit more in control. It was worth a try.
    Mom nodded and stowed her backpack overhead, while I shoved mine under the seat in front of me. I tried not to think too far ahead, focusing on putting the bag lunch from my mom in the seat-back pocket, right next to the bag for motion sickness, and pulling on my anti-nausea wristbands. Next, I kicked off my Keds and dug out my compression stockings. Now I’ll admit, they’re not particularly attractive, being long black socks that go up almost to my knees, but blood clots are nothing to mess around with. And [SB36][KL37]sitting around on an international flight increases your risk of developing one by almost 50 percent! I was not taking any chances.
    Finally, I pulled out the airplane safety card. I tightened my seat belt firmly across my lap, checked under my seat for the life jacket, and looked for the nearest exit. When I was done, I pulled out my journal so I could write everything down.
    I guess I’d better explain about my Doomsday Journal. After we had to drive home from Chicago, my parents started to notice how I seemed to have more fears than the average kid. I worried about the mean sixth grader [KL39]on the school bus, falling off the jungle gym, learning my math facts, forgetting my lunch, getting kidnapped, nuclear war, finding a razor blade in my Halloween candy, getting a Tylenol bottle with the safety seal removed—you get the idea.
    My parents didn’t know what to do. They told me again and again that I didn’t have to worry about those things, but it didn’t help. Finally, they took me to a child psychologist, Dr. Teresa. I liked her. We’d color happy pictures or build safe places with blocks. As I got older, she taught me about deep breathing and distracting myself when I started to feel anxious. And she was the one that came up with the idea of the journal.
    Dr. Teresa didn’t call it a Doomsday Journal; she just said maybe I should write down my fears and think about the worst-case scenario and how I would handle it. My parents thought that approach sounded a little weird, but my mom drove me to the store, and I picked out a hot-pink diary with a unicorn and rhinestones on the front. (It’s a little embarrassing to look at now.) Truthfully, I was pretty doubtful too, but my parents promised me a chocolate-vanilla-twist ice-cream cone with rainbow sprinkles if I tried it for one week.
    And the funny thing is, it worked! Well, mostly. Once I wrote down my math facts in my journal, I didn’t worry about forgetting them anymore. If I wrote down a bunch of different comeback lines I could use if the mean sixth grader teased me on the bus, I could relax and talk to my friends. (I was a little disappointed she never bothered me after I wrote them down—there were some real zingers!) Once I made a shopping list of all the nonperishable food supplies I’d like to have on hand in case there was a nuclear attack by the Soviets, I didn’t have to worry about it anymore.
    But some of my fears, especially the ones about illness or getting hurt, were harder to get rid of. Sometimes I’d get over my fear of choking on an apple, only to discover I was really much more afraid of popcorn getting stuck in my throat. It felt like a never-ending game of Whac-A-Mole. As soon as one fear was gone, another would pop up. So I kept writing.
    In fifth grade my friend Chrissy nicknamed it my “Doomsday Journal,” and the name stuck. By the time I turned twelve, I had filled three diaries, creating my own little reference collection of worries / survival guides. The journals were all packed in my checked luggage, except for my current one. Chrissy had given it to me for my birthday, right after she had heard I was going to Austria for the summer. It had an old-fashioned map on the cover and the words Don’t be afraid to get a little lost.
    That quote made me laugh because I was afraid of getting lost, but that was covered in my rainbow diary, otherwise known as Doomsday Journal #2, on page 47 (DJ #2, p. 47). Anyway, I pulled out my new map journal, flipped to the first blank page, picked up a pen, and started writing.
    International Plane Flight Safety Procedures
    Nearest exit: 25A, wing exit.
    If that exit is inaccessible, nearest exit is at front of plane.
    In case of a water landing remove life jacket from under seat.
    I drew a little sketch of recommended crash positions for an emergency landing.
    And so on. When I finished, Mom asked, “Did that help?”
    “Yeah,” I said, even though I wasn’t quite sure if it had. I focused on the flight attendant’s safety spiel (I already knew everything). We hadn’t even left the ground yet, and I already felt like I was going to throw up. I must have looked a little green, because Mom gestured to the motion-sickness bag in her seat-back pocket, but I waved her off.
    We turned onto the runway, the engines roared, and I grabbed Mom’s hand. Well, if I’m going to die, I hope it’s quick. Would dying in a plane crash be quick? I thought it probably would. We accelerated, and the speed pushed me back into my chair. I closed my eyes, and suddenly my stomach dropped as if we were on an elevator. I gave a little shriek.
    “It’s okay,” Mom said, squeezing my hand tighter. “We just left the ground. Look out the window.”
