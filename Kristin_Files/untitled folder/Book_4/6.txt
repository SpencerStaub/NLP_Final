The Happy Chicken
No one mentioned my tears when I got back into the car. Katarina chattered on about the lovely garden in front of my father’s town house. I imagined rows of beans, corn, and tomatoes, but there was no garden—it was only a little patch of grass, barely enough to mow. There were five town houses in a row, each with a small yard out front. The one next to my father’s was filled with dozens of ceramic gnomes: one with a dog by the front gate, one with an umbrella, one with a tiny watering can, one wearing sunglasses, one on skis[JL82][KL83], a baby in a diaper, a grandpa with a beard and a cane, and so on. In between the gnomes were flowers. Lots of flowers. There were boxes; there were baskets; there were pots. It looked like a flower shop run by Smurfs.
    “That’s Frau Gamperl’s house,” Katarina explained. “Felix, Sara, and I live on the other side.”
    At my father’s front door, Katarina gave me a hug and told me she would see us later. Sara waved, but Felix just kept reading as they walked away. I sighed with relief as they left. Finally, it was just me and my father.
    Dad smiled as if he were thinking the same thing. “Welcome home,” he said as he unlocked the door. “I know it might seem a little weird at first, but I really do want you to feel like this is your house too.”
    Inside, there was a big room with a dining table[SB84][KL85], a large L-shaped couch, a TV, and a stereo. To the left was a galley kitchen with a tiny table, only big enough for two. Everything looked new and clean, and there was a lot of light. Upstairs, there were three bedrooms—a large one with a balcony for my father, my dad’s study, and a bedroom for me.
    My room had a double bed, a desk by the window, and a couple of empty bookshelves. There was a small dresser in the corner. Everything was sleek and modern. It was also really hot. We dumped my bags in the room and went back downstairs.
    “Is there something wrong with the air-conditioning?” I asked. “It feels kind of warm in my room.”
    “Hmm?” Dad asked as he started to make some oatmeal on the stove[JL86][KL87]. “Oh, no one has air-conditioning here.”
    “What?”
    “Well, it doesn’t usually get this hot,” he said. “I think I have a fan in the basement.”
    We sat down for breakfast at the little table. Dad had made the oatmeal just the way he did at home, with a little honey and brown sugar. I was starting to feel a bit better, when I heard Katarina call “Hello, you two!” through the open window.
    She barged inside without even knocking. Sara followed, carrying a laundry basket full of wet clothes. Felix trailed them both, holding a bag of clothespins in one hand and a book in the other.
    “My laundry line is already full, and we have so much wash. Do you mind if we use yours?” She didn’t even wait for my father to answer, just strode through his living room and out onto his back patio. Katarina and Sara hung up pants and T-shirts; Felix handed them neon-pink clothespins without looking at them.
    “Go right ahead!” Dad called.
    “Don’t they have a dryer?” I grumbled.
    “No one has a dryer,” Dad explained. “It’s bad for the environment. That’s how Katarina and I met. The washer is in the community room across the way. I was looking for the dryer and asked Katarina where it was. She laughed and laughed at me!”
    The oatmeal, which a minute before had been delicious, suddenly felt lumpy in my mouth. “So how long have you two been . . . going out?” I asked.
    “About three months now,” Dad said. “I thought it was so sweet that she wanted to come to the airport with me to pick you up.”
    “Yeah,” I said. I stirred my oatmeal, even though it was already cool. Through the glass patio door, I noticed Sara watching us. When I caught her eye, she quickly looked away.
    “What happened to Sara’s family?” I asked.
    “I’m not entirely sure,” Dad said. “For some reason, they weren’t able to leave the country with her.”
    “Is there really fighting in her city?”
    “Yes.”
    “Mom’s not traveling to . . .”
    “Of course not,” Dad said. “Your mother is only visiting Western Europe. It’s perfectly safe.”
    That’s what Mom had said. I thought about Sara coming here all alone, leaving her family behind. “Is there anything we can do to help her find them?” I asked.
    “I’ve inquired at the US embassy, but since they aren’t American citizens . . .”
    At that moment, Katarina walked back into the kitchen and kissed my father on the cheek. “You are the best!” She glanced at my bowl of oatmeal. “What?! That’s all you’re having for breakfast?”
    “I like oatmeal,” I said.
    “No, no, no.” She grabbed my father’s arm. “You must come over to our place. We will have a real breakfast, a Sunday brunch, to welcome your daughter.”
    Suddenly, I was being shoved out the door when I just wanted to have a quiet talk with my father. We were marched two doors down to Katarina’s house.
    The table[JL90][KL91] in their great room was large, big enough for eight, so the five of us had plenty of room. My father and I were instructed to sit while Katarina, Sara, and Felix got things ready. I watched Sara intently. I would be a mess if I didn’t know where my mom was, but Sara’s hands were steady as she brought food to the table: pastries with apricots and cherries; a plate of cold cuts with salamis and hams; a basket of round rolls, some with poppy seeds and some without; a cheese spread; a container of honey; and two carafes, one with coffee and one with hot chocolate. And finally, in front of each plate, a hard-boiled egg in a little eggcup.
    Well, I did like eggs. So after everyone sat down, I tried to peel mine. I tapped it on the table until it cracked. Bright-yellow yolk oozed out. “Oh,” I said, “it’s not fully cooked!”
    I looked up and everyone was staring, even Felix. I thought Katarina would be embarrassed, but she was looking at me as if I were the one who was crazy.[JL92][KL93] 
    “Um, I don’t think you cooked them long enough,” I said.
    Katarina laughed. “Oh, Schatzi,” she said, “they’re soft-boiled eggs.”
    I glanced at Dad.[JL94][KL95] 
    “We didn’t eat soft-boiled eggs at home in Virginia, did we, Becca?” Dad said kindly. “But they’re actually pretty good. Look. You slice off the top.” He used his knife to cut the shell, removing the top curve of the egg like a little hat. He pushed his egg over toward me and handed me a tiny spoon. “Put some salt and pepper on it, and you just scoop it out of the shell.”
    The yolk oozed over the side. “It’s raw!”
    “It’s not raw,” Dad insisted. “It’s just not as fully cooked as you’re used to.”
    “But, Dad!” I lowered my voice. “What about salmonella?”
    “Try it, try it!” urged Katarina.
    “Raw eggs can make you sick,” I said. It was in Doomsday Journal [JL96][KL97]#3, somewhere near the end. Consuming raw or undercooked eggs is a major risk factor for contracting salmonellosis.
    “Oh no, no, no,” Katarina trilled. “These are eggs from happy chickens!”
    “What the heck are happy chickens?” I said.
    “Becca doesn’t like to eat foods that aren’t completely cooked,” Dad explained. He sounded a little embarrassed. Or maybe he thought I was being rude, but I didn’t care. I was not going to end up with food poisoning on my first day in a new country.
    Katarina didn’t seem offended. “Happy chickens,” she explained, “are from happy farms. Where the animals get to run around and eat freely and aren’t cooped up in cages like they are in some places. Because we have happy chickens, we don’t have the same problems with salmonella like you do in the United States.”
    That sounded pretty weird to me. I glanced at Dad.
    He shrugged.
    “I think I’ll have a pastry instead,” I said, reaching for an apricot thingy.
    Dad took the egg back and scooped out a spoonful of yolk.
    “Dad!”
    “They’re good,” he said. “Katarina writes about economics with a specialty in food production. She knows what she’s talking about. See, her article is right here on the front page[SB98][KL99].” He handed me a tabloid-style newspaper. It was all in German, of course. I couldn’t read the headline, but underneath in bold letters was Katarina Müller.
    “Very impressive,” I said. To be extra polite, I decided to flip through the pages, pretending I was actually interested. Page 3 had a picture of a smiling woman. There was only one thing odd[JL100][KL101]. The woman wasn’t wearing a shirt. Or a bra.
    “What kind of paper is this?!” I pushed it back toward my dad.
    “Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.” He looked embarrassed.
    “What is it, Ben?” Katarina asked.
    He held the paper out to her.
    She looked at him blankly.
    He pointed to the naked woman.
    “Oh.” She turned to me and smiled. “You Americans are so funny about nudity.”
    “What kind of paper do you write for?” I asked.
    “A normal one. I mean, it’s not the New York Times, but . . .”
    “There’s a topless woman in the newspaper!” I exclaimed.
    “That’s just the Girl of the Day,” Katarina explained.
    “Okay,” Dad said, folding up the paper. “Let’s put the paper away and enjoy our breakfast.”
    I caught a glimpse of Sara looking up for just a second over the edge of her coffee cup. And I swear she was smiling.
***
After breakfast, I was exhausted. Though it was eleven o’clock in Vienna, it was five in the morning back home. I’d barely slept on the plane, so I wanted to take a nap, but Katarina insisted I go outside in the sunshine to “reset my internal clock.”
    “Let’s all take a bike ride!” she suggested.
    “No,” I said firmly. “I don’t feel like riding a bike.”
    The truth was, I didn’t feel like riding a bike, because I couldn’t ride a bike. Sure, it’s a little unusual for a twelve-year-old not to be able to ride a bike. But the statistics on bike accidents? They are just scary. (See DJ #1, pp. 22–23.)[SB102][KL103]
    “Okay, a walk, then,” Katarina replied. “Come along, Schatzi.”
    “Why does she keep calling me that?” I asked my father as Katarina led us up a dirt path through a vineyard. “Doesn’t she know my name?”
    “Of course she does,” Dad whispered back. “Schatzi is a term of endearment, like sugar or sweetie.”
    “Well, tell her to just call me Becca.”
    “Okay,” Dad said. “Will do.”
    I didn’t want to like the vineyards, but they were pretty. There were rows and rows of grapevines on stakes and a dirt path that ran between them, up and down rolling hills. It would have been [SB106]picturesque—if I hadn’t been so tired. I could barely put one foot in front of the other.
    Finally, Katarina agreed I’d had enough sunshine and I was allowed to go back to my room. [SB107]I collapsed on the strange bed and was instantly asleep.
    When I woke up, it was dark, and the house was quiet. I looked at the clock on the dresser, and it was just past midnight. I guessed Dad was asleep, but I felt wide awake. And I was hungry.
    I crept downstairs to the kitchen. There was a note on the kitchen table:
Guess you were more tired than you thought! No worries, sweetie. I’m going to bed now, but if you wake up and are hungry, feel free to help yourself to anything in the kitchen. Mom called earlier—she said not to wake you. She’ll try you again tomorrow. Afraid I have to go to work in the morning, [SB108][KL109]but Sara and Felix will be over at 9 a.m. They’re planning to show you around the city. I’ll be home by 5 p.m. and we’ll have dinner. Love you![JL110][KL111]
    Dad had told me to make myself at home, but it still felt odd, prowling around a kitchen that wasn’t mine in the middle of the night. I opened every single cabinet, looking for a jar of Skippy or Jif, but I couldn’t find any kind of peanut butter. I felt ridiculously disappointed. I sat down at the kitchen table and felt something uncomfortable in my pocket. When I pulled it out, I realized it was the flyer about Sara’s family.
I suddenly had a lump in my throat. I wanted to go upstairs and get my Doomsday Journal. Write down all my worries. How Dad might get food poisoning and die. How Katarina thought I was a prude just because I didn’t like my news with a side helping of naked lady. How Sara was separated from her family.     I got a glass of water and took a big sip, but I couldn’t get rid of the feeling that there was something stuck. Finally, I remembered Mom had given me the number of the youth hostel where she was staying. Maybe she was awake with jet lag too. And if not, she wouldn’t mind me waking her up.
    I ran upstairs to get her number. It didn’t seem right to throw away Sara’s paper, so I tucked it away in my Doomsday Journal. Then I returned to the kitchen and studied the phone on the counter. It was big and red and squat. It had a rotary dial. I picked up the handset, which had a cord. Even the dial tone sounded strange. I dialed the country code. It beeped twice. And then a recording came on in English, prompting me to enter my number and my account code. After what seemed like forever, the line began to ring.
    It rang and rang and rang, but no one answered. After a few minutes, I hung up and started to cry.
    There was a creak on the stairs.
    I jumped.
    “Becca?” my dad called out.
    I wiped my eyes as Dad came padding down the stairs in a navy bathrobe and pajamas. “Why are you up?” Dad asked. “Is everything okay?”
    “No,” I said. “I tried to call Mom, but she didn’t pick up the phone.” I thought about how Sara was unable to call her mother. “I think something must have happened to her!”
    “Sweetie,” my dad said kindly. “A youth hostel isn’t like a hotel. They don’t have phones in the room. And no one’s at the front desk to answer the phone at night.”
    I looked at the clock on the stove: 12:27 a.m.
    “Mom is fine,” Dad reassured me. “You’re worrying for no reason.”
    I didn’t answer.
    “Are you hungry?” he asked. “You slept through lunch and dinner.”
    “Yes,” I said. “And you promised to have some peanut butter!”
    “I do.” He rummaged in the cabinet and pulled out a tiny jar, about half the size of the smallest jar of peanut butter you could buy at home. Still, when Dad opened it, a familiar nutty smell wafted out. He [SB112][KL113]grabbed a leftover roll from breakfast, sliced it in half, and spread peanut butter thickly onto each side.
    The peanut butter tasted so good, it almost made me start crying again.
    “I know things seem strange,” Dad said. “But—[JL114]”
    “I liked my life as it was!” I whispered. “Why did it have to change?”
    Dad was silent for a long time. His hair was plastered to the side of his face from sleeping.  And why is he wearing a robe and pajamas anyway? Sweats and a T-shirt had always been good enough for him at home.
    Finally, he cleared this throat. “Becca, things always change. You need to give yourself some time to adjust. Spending the summer in Vienna is a good challenge for you. It might even be fun. But you need to give it a real try.”
    I finished my sandwich, gave my dad a hug, and trekked back upstairs to bed. I’d promised Dad I would try to have an open mind. And I would try. But let’s be honest.
    I wasn’t a happy chicken.[SB115]
