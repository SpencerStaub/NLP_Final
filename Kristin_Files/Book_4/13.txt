Produce, Pizza, and Peppermint
Over the next few weeks, we fell into a routine. In the mornings, Felix and I would run errands or go sightseeing with Sara; we’d spend afternoons reading or playing board games. (Dr. Teresa firmly believed that being tired increased anxiety, and I’d overheard Dad telling Sara to build in more downtime so I wouldn’t get quite so exhausted.) In the evenings, Dad and I would alternate between eating dinner with just each other and having a bigger meal with Felix, Katarina, and Sara.
    Mom and I chatted about twice each week. It was hard to get in touch with her at the youth hostels (“which aren’t only open to youth,” Mom told me on the phone, “although I’ve been told I look much younger than forty-five”), but she sounded so excited. She’d danced around the fountain at Mirabell Gardens while singing “Do-Re-Mi” and jumped from bench to bench while humming “Sixteen Going on Seventeen”[JL185][KL186] at Schloss Hellbrunn. The connection wasn’t always the greatest—and Mom still needed to feed money into the pay phone to connect to the local country number. You had to pay for local calls by the minute too. [JL187][KL188]But it was nice to hear her voice, even if just for a little while.
    Dad and I did get to have those peanut butter sandwiches. He went a little overboard, buying three kinds of bread: “toast bread,” Semmeln (traditional Austrian round rolls), and a small dark loaf so thick and nutty, I could practically taste all the fiber. He also got three types of jam: apricot, raspberry, and blueberry. We had our own taste test, mixing and matching all the flavors. We used up a whole jar of peanut butter, not because we ate so much, but because the jars were so incredibly small.
    But that wasn’t a problem, because people in Austria seemed to go grocery shopping every single day. If you felt like eating a peach, you just went to the store and picked one up. It was sure to be juicy, sweet, and ready to eat—no need to let it sit for a few days and ripen on the counter. You had to bring your own bag with you—or pay money for a reusable one. They didn’t pack your bags for you either, so Sara liked having me and Felix along to do that for her.
    No one smiled either, not at the grocery store or at any other shop. “Why would they smile?” Sara asked. “Their job is to sell you stuff,” Felix pointed out, “not to pretend to be your friend.” Only Dad understood. “I know!” he exclaimed. “I spent the first month thinking I had accidentally done something to offend everyone. They all seemed so grumpy! But it’s just a different custom. No one has the expectation that someone working in retail will be friendly and cheerful. It’s actually kind of nice once you get used to it. I mean, sometimes I just want to buy a liter of milk without engaging in small talk.”
    Speaking of milk, that was odd too. It came in brown glass bottles, which you returned to the store once you were done with them. The milk was so thick that the first time Dad poured me a glass, I thought he had accidentally given me cream. Sara gamely helped me search for skim or 2 percent, but the only reduced-fat milk we could find came in boxes, didn’t need to be refrigerated, and tasted awful. Katarina found it amusing that I still drank milk—“It’s only for little children!” I tried to explain that everyone drank milk at home, even Dad sometimes, but I don’t think she believed me.
    About two weeks into my trip, Dad had a special event at work. There was a conference with a dinner and a party after, and he said, “I’m afraid I won’t be home until really, really late.” It was decided that I would spend the evening at Katarina’s, and then Sara would come home with me and sleep on our couch.
    Katarina took Sara, Felix, and me out for pizza at an Italian place nearby. It was a warm evening, but we sat outside because there was so much smoke in the restaurant—and it wasn’t air-conditioned anyway. But it wasn’t too bad under the trees. We ordered large bottles of sparkling water, and it was almost as refreshing as soda. The pizza was paper thin, and instead of sharing one, like we always did at home, we each ordered our own. I asked for pepperoni and was disappointed to discover Peperoni[JL189][KL190] means peppers in German. (Felix said I should have ordered “salami” instead.) Luckily, Katarina liked peppers, so she switched plates with me. Her pizza was plain, topped only with sauce, blobs of mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. It looked a little funny, but it tasted oh so good.
    “Felix,” Katarina said between bites of pizza, “I thought we should start planning your birthday.”
    “No.”
    “But it’s next week!”
    “Yes, it is,” said Felix.
    “Don’t you want to have a party?”
    “No,” said Felix. “I want to have cake at home and then go to the movies. Like we do every year.”
    Katarina made a face. “That was fine for last year. You were turning twelve. But this is thirteen! You’ll be a teenager.”
    It was Felix’s turn to make a face. “Don’t remind me.” He took another bite of his ham-topped pizza.[KL192]
    “But being a teenager is wonderful!” Katarina exclaimed. “All the new freedom! The excitement! It’s a fabulous time in your life.”
    That was not how I heard most people describe being a teenager, but hey, I was only twelve, so what did I know?
    “Maybe for you, Mama,” Felix said, “but I’m different.”
    “We could have it at a Heuriger,” Katarina continued. “Right up the road.”
    “What’s a Heuriger?” I asked.
    “It’s like a little tavern,” Katarina explained. “Very Austrian. They serve new wine and bread, cheese, and salami on a cutting board. It’s casual. Fun. There’s even music!”
    “Wine?” I asked. “For thirteen-year-olds?!”
    “No, no, no.” Katarina laughed. “The wine is for the grown-ups. There’s sparkling grape juice for the kids.”
    “If we have to go out, I’d rather just come here again,” Felix said. “Then we can just jump on the bus to the movie theater.”
    “But we come here all the time!” Katarina said.
    “That’s because I like it,” Felix said.
    “Becca has already been here,” Katarina insisted. “A Heuriger would be something new.”
    “But I like not new things,” Felix said.
    “Don’t make a big deal about this, Schatzi,” Katarina said. “Just invite a few friends from school and have a party. It can be a little one.”
    “Ich will aber nicht.”
    I could tell he was upset. Felix rarely lapsed into German when I was around.
    “Okay, okay,” Katarina said. “We’ll discuss it later.”
    Luckily, they did not discuss it later. Instead, after dinner we sat around their living room playing a silly board game called Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht. Each person had four colored pegs; you threw dice to move them around the board, trying to get them all Home. If you landed on an opponent’s piece, you could send them back to Start. Basically, it was the German version of Sorry![JL193][KL194] It was pretty fun!
    When it was time to go to bed, Sara and I walked back to my dad’s house. She brought a bag of overnight supplies with her: toothbrush, pajamas, etc. I got out a blanket and an extra pillow and helped her make up a little bed on the big L-shaped couch, since we didn’t have a guest room. Then I brushed my teeth and crawled into bed, pretty sure I was going to dream about pepperoni and peppers and parties and moving little colored pegs around a board.
    I was woken by a scream. At first, I thought I might have imagined it. It was raining hard, and as I lay in bed, lightning lit up the window, followed a moment later by a boom of thunder. Then I heard it again—a loud, short shriek.
    I jumped out of bed and ran, panicked, down the stairs. The lightning flashed again, and for a moment I could see Sara thrashing about on the couch. She screamed again, but I breathed a sigh of relief. She was just dreaming.
    I turned on the lamp on the side table next to the couch. Sara was sweating, the green lock of hair sticking to her forehead like a piece of overcooked spinach. I put my hand on her shoulder and shook her gently.
    “Sara,” I said. “Wake up! You’re having a nightmare.”
    She moaned and tried to pull away from me. Then the living room lit up from the lightning again, and the room shook with thunder. Sara opened her eyes with a shriek.
    “It’s me, Becca!” I said. “It’s just a thunderstorm.”
    Sara blinked once or twice, and then something clicked and she recognized me again. “Oh, Becca!” she said. “I had such a bad dream!”
    “It’s okay,” I said.
    Sara huddled in the corner of the couch, her blanket wrapped around her. She looked terrible, with big dark shadows under her eyes. It scared me a little. 
    “Can I get you something?” I asked.
    Sara took a deep breath in, held it for a long moment, and then exhaled slowly. “Could you make a pot of tea?”
    “Sure.” I was glad to have something concrete to do. Dad had an electric kettle. All you had to do was fill it with water and plug it in, and in a couple of minutes, you’d have boiling water. It was so fast! Something to do with the different current in Europe.
    Sara got up from the couch and went to the bathroom. She looked a little better when she came out. She’d splashed some water on her face, though her eyes were still puffy.
    “Do you want peppermint or chamomile?” I asked.
    “Pfefferminze,” she said.
    “Okay.”
    The tea was loose—another thing my dad had had to show me how to use—but I scooped some out of the tin and put it into a [KL197]cloth bag on a little metal ring that sat on the lip of the teapot. Then I poured the hot water over it. The smell of peppermint drifted into the living room. It smelled like candy canes[SB198][KL199] and Christmas.
    “Okay if I put on some music?” Sara asked.
    “Of course,” I said.
    She took a CD out of her bag and went to the stereo. Mournful violins began to play.
    “What’s that?” I asked.
    “La Traviata,” she said. “My favorite opera.”
    Okay. So it wasn’t what I listened to when I couldn’t sleep at night,[SB200][KL201] but if it made her feel better, I didn’t mind. The clock in the kitchen chimed midnight.
    “Becca,” Sara asked shyly. “Will you sit with me?”
    “Sure.” I ran upstairs and grabbed a blanket off my bed[SB203][KL204]. I poured each of us a mug of tea, and we settled in on the couch, each of us curled up on one end of the sectional, our feet meeting in the corner, our hands warmed by clutching the mugs. I felt cozy and safe, listening to the rain outside.
    Sara was staring at her tea as if she expected to find a prize at the bottom of the cup.
    “Want to tell me about your dream?” I asked.
    She looked up in surprise.
    “You don’t have to,” I added quickly. “But if I have a nightmare, it always makes me feel better to tell someone.”
    “I not want to scare you.”
    I shrugged. “I’m not scared of dreams.”
    “You scared of eggs,” she pointed out.
    “Raw eggs are scary!” I insisted. “But a bad dream can’t hurt you.”
    “Okay,” she said finally. “I will tell.”
