 37 – I OVERHEAR ANOTHER CONVERSATION

      Mrs. Walker had come around to the idea of Emma being in the play.  In fact to hear her talk, you’d think she’d come up with the idea herself.  She sent a telegram to a friend in Boston, who mailed her a piece of brightly patterned cloth.  The multicolored fabric came “straight from Africa,” as Emma reminded me at least once a day.  Instead of cutting it up and sewing it, Mrs. Walker showed Emma how to tie and pin the cloth so that it made a dress.  
      Emma drilled me on my spelling while her mama washed, combed, and plaited her hair, finally adding shiny, colorful beads to the ends.  Pearl so loved the beads, she begged Mrs. Walker to do the same to her hair.  “Your hair won’t hold, sweetie,” Mrs. Walker said to Pearl, but she did it anyway, covering Pearl’s head with tiny, tight braids.  That evening Pearl drove our family crazy shaking her head to hear the beads rattle.  Every time she did so, a few more beads would pop off and go flying.  We spent most of the evening picking colored beads off the floor.
      I wanted to look just like the lion tamer in the real circus, so Mama spent hours sewing together bits of leather left over from patching saddles to make me a fringed vest that looked like it had been mauled by a lion.  Pa even found an old whip in the barn from when we had horses instead of a car.  Ulman loaned me a pair of boots that were only a bit too big, Ollie cut down a thick leather belt to my size, and Elman threw in an old hat.  When I swaggered into school for the first dress rehearsal, Mrs. Seay smiled and said, “Can I help you, Mr. Lion Tamer?”  Even Bobby laughed and said, “Roar, roar!”
      A few days later me and Emma were helping Mr. Walker sort the mail.  Actually, me and Mr. Walker were sorting, Emma was hiding in the back corner, reading her birthday present.  Her mama had given her a book of poems by a Robert Snow or Ice or something like that.  The front bell rang and Doc Haley came in.  Mr. Walker looked up.  “Hello Doc,” he said.  “You expecting a letter?”
      “No.  I wanted to speak to you,” said Doc Haley.
      Mr. Walker stopped sorting.  
      “A couple of us at the church been a little concerned about you lately,” Doc went on.
      I ducked behind a sack of mail, hoping the men would forget I was there.  Grownups always have the most interesting conversations when they forget you’re around.
      “Why is that?” asked Mr. Walker.
      “We don’t think your daughter ought to be in that school play.”
      Emma finally put down her book.  Mr. Walker laughed and continued sorting.  
      “Mr. Walker, we’ve spent a long time getting where we are today,” Doc went on.  “And a couple of families are afraid your daughter being in that play is gonna bring on a whole new bunch of problems.”
      “Well, I thank you for your concern, but there’s nothing to be worried about.”
      “Mr. Walker, this here’s Alabama.  You might be a big shot up North, but here you’re just another Negra.  You don’t play by the rules, you’re risking trouble.”
      “Mr. Haley, I play by the rules.  And if I’m told to take the postmaster’s exam every year, I’ll take it, even if white men only have to pass it once.  But I’m risking trouble every day I show up for work.”  He struggled with his pant leg, pulling it up.  His calf was lined with twisted old scars.  Emma winced, even though I’m sure she’d seen her daddy’s leg before.  
      “I received this coming home from my first day of work in Boston.  Seems like some white boys didn’t like getting their mail from a nigger.  But there are some things that are worth fighting for.  You’d do well to remember that.”
      He jerked his pant leg back down.  “And if your own self-respect isn’t worth that much to you, think of your son.  I’m not going to tell my own daughter she can’t be in a play because of the color of her skin.”
      Doc Haley shifted his weight from one foot to the other and stared at the ground.  “Now, Mr. Walker, I didn’t mean to...”
      “You want to do something for this town?  Next time you see an injustice, take a stand.  It’s worth the risk.”
      Doc Haley turned and stomped out.
      Mr. Walker cursed up a storm, then remembered we were still there.  “Get back to work you two,” he snapped.
	We jumped up and started sorting.
