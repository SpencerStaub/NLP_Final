 52 – HOW BIG FOOT GOT HIS NAME

      We followed Mrs. Pooley ‘round the side of the store to the wooden staircase that went up to the rooms where she lived.  She led us into her kitchen and put on a pot of water.  There was a large knife on the table, and for a minute, I thought she was gonna stab us both to death and cook our bones.  But she only used the knife to cut a couple of slices from a pound cake.  
      A few minutes later we were sitting around her small table, each with a cup of tea and a slice of cake.  Mrs. Pooley stirred her tea round and round with a spoon, just like Mama did when there was something she didn’t want to say.  
      “When Big Foot was just a little boy,” Mrs. Pooley said finally, “his daddy would come in from the fields and take off his shoes.  Little Gabriel, that was his name then, would jump into his daddy’s shoes and shuffle around the house.  ‘Look at me, Mama!’ he’d say.  ‘I’ve got big feets!’” She smiled at the memory.  
      I finally noticed how thin Mrs. Pooley was.  Instead of wrinkles, the skin was pulled tight across her face.  Me and Emma didn’t move as she kept talking.  
      “But he always was a violent boy.  Got in fights at school; tortured stray dogs around town.  Then there was that man in Selma.  I knew it wasn’t an accident, but I loved him anyway.  He was my only child.”  She paused.  “You used to remind me of him, Dit.  That’s why I asked you to run my errands.  But you changed.”  
      She took a deep breath.  “I think it’s terrible that a nice boy like you runs around with a nigger.”
      Emma stared at her piece of cake.  I couldn’t take my eyes off Mrs. Pooley.  Her dress was a couple of sizes too big and she had a sash tied about her waist.  Without it holding her together, it seemed her old body might just fall apart.  
      “‘Course Big Foot had a nigger for a brother.  I always pretended I didn’t know - never breathed a word of it to my husband - but I wasn’t no fool.  I knew my husband liked the Negra women, and Doc Haley was the spitting image of him.  Thing is, most people didn’t see it, ‘cause they couldn’t get past his color.
      “But Doc Haley’s wife worked as my maid ‘til the day she died.  When she was brushing my hair or sweeping the floor, she often talked about what a kind man her husband was.  ‘Kind’ was not a word I’d ever use to describe my son.  If Doc got into a fight with Big Foot, it must have been my boy’s fault.”  
      Mrs. Pooley’s voice started to tremble.  “If I hadn’t told Big Foot that nigger girl was in the play, he wouldn’t have gotten into the fight with Doc.  I already killed one of my husband’s sons.  I won’t kill the other.”
      She shifted uncomfortably in her chair.  “Go get me the sugar bowl, Dit.”  She pointed to a blue ceramic container on the counter.  I got up and brought it to her.
      Mrs. Pooley cradled it in her wrinkled hands, then took off the lid and dumped the sugar onto the kitchen table.  
      I stared at her.  She was crazy.  Any second now she was gonna pull out a gun or a knife - or maybe the pound cake had been poisoned.  Not that any one of us had choked down more than a bite.
      It was Emma who noticed the bit of silver metal sticking up out of the mound of sugar.  She picked it up and shook off the grains.  It was a large, silver key.
      “Now get out of here,” Mrs. Pooley snapped.  “Before I change my mind and tell someone what you’re gonna do.”
