 43 – CORNBREAD LIKE SAND

      Doc Haley was thrown in jail that very afternoon.  Dr. Griffith barely had a chance to stitch up his head before Mayor Davidson came to take him away.  Me, Elbert, and Emma all swore the killing had been self-defense, but Mayor Davidson just shook his head.  
      “What else you gonna do with a Negra who shoots a white man?” he asked.
      “Jail’s probably the safest place for you right now,” Dr. Griffith said to Doc.  “At least ‘til things calm down.”
      Doc Haley didn’t answer, but he went quietly as Mayor Davidson led him off to jail.
      That night, I relived the scene in the barbershop over and over in my dreams.  Each time, I managed to keep my mouth shut and Big Foot got out alive.  And each time I awoke, I realized that dreaming ain’t worth squat.  The only thing I was good at was killing things.
      The next morning I went by the jailhouse.  Just snuck in the same back door me and Chip had used and walked down the stairs.  Doc Haley was in the same cell I had been locked in, sitting on an old dirty cot.  He looked like he hadn’t slept a wink. 
      “Hi,” I said quietly.  “I brought you breakfast.”  I passed a couple of my mama’s biscuits through the prison bars.  Doc Haley took them and ate them, but he didn’t say a word.  I could see the stitches where Dr. Griffith had sewed up the side of his head.  I forced myself to look Doc straight in the eyes, but he wouldn’t return my gaze.
      “I’m sorry, Doc,” I said finally.  “I never meant for this to happen.”
      “I know, Dit.”
      I expected him to be angry or maybe even scared, but he just sounded sad.  That made me feel even worse.  
      “If you hadn’t fired Big Foot would have killed you,” I said.
      Doc Haley shook his head.  “I don’t think the jury will see it that way.”
      We stood there in silence for a long moment.  The clock in city hall struck eight.  
      “I gotta go now,” I said finally.  “But I’ll visit you every day after school.”
      “No,” said Doc firmly.  “I don’t want you to come here again.”
      “But…”
      “Dit, there’s just one thing I’m asking of you and it’s this.”  He paused to make sure I was listening then spoke real slow.  “Go home and don’t come back.”
      He lifted his head and looked at me then, and his eyes looked just like a dog who’s broke his leg and knows you’re gonna put him down.
      
      That afternoon after school, I stopped by the barbershop.  Figured it would only get harder the longer I waited.  And I had to see Elbert.
      Elbert was on his hands and knees, scrubbing at the bloodstains on the floor.  Soon as I set foot in the barbershop, he stopped and looked up.  “What do you want?”  
      “Elbert, I… I’m really sorry.”
      “You should be.  It’s your fault my pa’s in jail.”
      “I didn’t mean to…”
      “But you did,” Elbert snapped.  “You told the secret I trusted you with.”
      “I’m sorry.”  I didn’t know what else to say.
      “If you had just kept your mouth shut for once, none of this would have happened.”  He was yelling now, but I didn’t even flinch.  No matter how he said it, he was right.
      “I’ll tell the judge what really happened and he’ll…”
      “Don’t you know nothing?” yelled Elbert.  “Your opinion means squat.  All that jury’s gonna hear is my daddy shot a white man.”
      “I’ll find a way to make it up to you.”
      “How?”  Elbert scoffed.  “What you gonna do?”
      He was right.  There was nothing I could do.  There was nothing else I could say.
      “Just get out of here.  And don’t ever come back!”

	I ran.  Down Main Street and across the field and through the woods and all the way up the mound to our secret cave.  I sat there in the dark with the door closed and cried.  Not sure how long I stayed there.  After a while, I realized Emma had come in too.  She didn’t say nothing, just handed me a root beer and we drank in silence.  
        
      My nerves were rubbed raw as a peeled carrot by the time Big Foot’s funeral rolled around.  I had known Big Foot my entire life – how could I not go to his funeral?  On the other hand, attending seemed disloyal to Doc Haley and Elbert.  But they weren’t talking to me so I went with the rest of my family.
      Big Foot looked handsome and peaceful, lying in his coffin.  He was dressed in his pa’s Confederate uniform and a starched white shirt.  I stood a long time, looking into his still face.  They’d put something on his cheeks, ‘cause I couldn’t see his scar.  Pa stood behind me and didn’t say a word. 
      After Big Foot’s body was in the ground, everyone met for a potluck supper in Mrs. Pooley’s store.  I hung around outside and watched Mayor Davidson turn Big Foot’s things over to Mrs. Pooley.  There wasn’t much - just the deed to the old house, the eagle in her cage, a large ring of keys, and a small suitcase.  Mrs. Pooley started crying.  Mayor Davidson patted her back as she sobbed. 
      I went inside and ate some chicken I couldn’t taste.  For once, I wasn’t hungry.  Even my mama’s cornbread tasted like sand.
