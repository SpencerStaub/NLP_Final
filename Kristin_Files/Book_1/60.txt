 59 – THE TALK

      The next morning I woke up early and went outside to chop some wood.  My thoughts were still in a muddle and there ain’t nothing like chopping wood to clear your head.  I’d been chopping for a good half an hour when Pa came out of the house and walked over to where I was working.  
      “Dit,” said Pa.  “I need to talk to you.”
      “I’m sorry for running off,” I said.  There was a rhythm to the chopping.  If I concentrated real hard, maybe I wouldn’t have to think about nothing else.
      Pa waved a hand in the air.  “Shoot, I ain’t upset about that.  Your mama worries too much.  I knew you were okay.”
       I kept chopping.  “Then what’d you want to talk about?”
      Pa was silent for a moment.   “I know what you and Emma did,” he said finally.  
      I let my axe fall to the ground.  “You do?”
      “Dr. Griffith told me,” said Pa.
      “Oh.”  I sat down on a stump.  “I’m sorry.”
      “Sorry?” asked Pa.
      “Are you real mad?”  I asked.  Despite all the growing I’d been doing, Pa was still taller and stronger than me.  I wondered if he’d make me cut my own switch for a whipping.  
      Pa shook his head.  “Dit, I’m proud of you.”
      I stared up at my pa.  He was smiling and in the sunlight, his hair was exactly the same color as mine.  “It took a lot of courage to do what you did,” he said.  “And brains too.”
      “The brains was mainly Emma,” I said.
      Pa laughed.  “I ain’t too good at putting my thoughts into words, Dit.  But I wanted to give you something.”  He pressed some crumpled papers into my hands.  I carefully unfolded them.  They were two dollar bills. 
      “Is this so I can enter the 4th hunt?” I asked.
      “You can do whatever you want with it,” said Pa.
      We stood there in silence for a moment.
      “Are you ever gonna give me the talk?” I asked.
      “The talk?” Pa asked, then laughed.  “Oh, that talk.”
      “Well, are you?”
      Pa shook his head.  “The part about girls, it’s just too embarrassing.  Ask Raymond.  But the part about being a man, you don’t need that.  That you already know.”
      He put his hand on my shoulder and I felt like a million bucks.  
      
      Late that afternoon, I stood on the banks of the Black Warrior.  There wasn’t no more wood to chop, but throwing stones was almost as good.  I skipped them across the water, watching them bounce six, seven, eight times.  After a while, I got a prickly feeling on the back of my neck.  I looked up.  
      Emma stood at the edge of the forest.  
      I nodded at her and went back to throwing stones.  
      Emma picked up a couple of stones and started throwing herself.  The sun went down some more and I watched her stones skip across the pink water.  
      “My pa gave me money to enter the 4th hunt,” I said finally.  
      “Oh,” she said.  She opened her mouth like she was gonna argue with me, then closed it.  Her shoulders dropped, but she smiled as she said, “Sorry I won’t be here to see you win it.”
      I knew how much she hated the whole idea of the 4th hunt.  Also knew that she finally understood what it meant to me.  And now, suddenly, I wasn’t sure I was even gonna enter.
      “Sorry I ran off yesterday,” I said.
      “It’s okay.” 
      “Do we have to talk about you leaving?”  I asked.
      “No,” said Emma.  “Not if you don’t want to.”
       We skipped some more stones.  
      “You know, I wouldn’t have told on you,” Emma said finally.
      “What?”
      “About the window.  And the buzzard.  Even if you hadn’t helped me.  I was just bluffing.”
      “I know.”  I knew that, and lots of other things.  But I couldn’t say them.  I just took her hand and held it in my own, my fingers next to hers.  I couldn’t stop staring at them.  We stood in silence for a long, long time.
