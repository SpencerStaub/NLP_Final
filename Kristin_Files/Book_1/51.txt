 50 – A CHANGE OF PLANS

	The day before the hanging, I tipped over the bucket when I was milking the cow.  I also pinched my pinkie in the outhouse door, lost all my marbles in a game at recess, got every single problem wrong on my math test, and broke my brand new fountain pen by accidentally sitting on it.  But what bothered me most was that I still couldn’t decide if we should tell Elbert about our plan.  I had tried the night before, but Elbert had turned and walked away.  I hadn’t followed him.  Emma thought it was best not to get his hopes up.  I guessed she was right.
      So after school I walked past the barbershop and went to check the snares I had set.  The first two were empty and I started to get nervous.  If I couldn’t catch a rabbit, we wouldn’t have no blood and the whole plan might fall apart.  But in the third snare I found a large brown swamp rabbit.  It stared at me with wide, scared eyes.  The rope was pulled tight around its left leg.  I picked it up by the scruff of its neck, gentle as a mama cat, and untangled its limb.
	“It’s all right,” I said softly.  “Everything’s gonna be okay.”  I hated lying, even if the poor old rabbit couldn’t understand a word.  
	I put the brown rabbit into a large basket I had borrowed from my mama.  She used it for picnics and it had a nice lid you could shut with a latch.  Stuffed a couple of carrots in too, so at least the rabbit wouldn’t go hungry.  Took the basket back to our barn and hid it in Pa’s old wheelbarrow, next to the stack of flour sacks filled with dirt.  The two kittens we had rescued from the river had gotten sleek and fat on the mice in our barn.  One of them slept on top of a flour sack.  The other danced around my feet, meowing for a bowl of cream like Emma sometimes brought.
	I was too worried to eat much at supper that night, even though we had ham, green beans, and biscuits with butter and honey.  No one said much.  I knew they were all thinking about Doc Haley and the hanging scheduled for ten tomorrow morning.  
	After supper I went over to Emma’s to do my homework.  Found her crying at the kitchen table.  She’d gotten a 75 on a history test.  Her mama’d spent the whole afternoon yelling at her and asking why.  Emma wasn’t good at lying, but she couldn’t tell her mama the truth.  We’d spent so much time planning recently, she hadn’t had no time to study.  
	“Glad to know you need to study too,” I said.  “I thought you were just born knowing everything.”
	Emma cried harder.  
	“Shoot, Emma, a 75 is nothing to cry over.  It’s just a number on a piece of paper.”  	
      “What if it doesn’t work?” Emma sobbed, and I finally realized she wasn’t crying about the history test.  I didn’t have no answer, so I just held her hand and let her cry for both of us.  
	I went home soon after that and went to bed early.  Me, Robert, Earl, and Raymond share a bedroom on the second floor.  I sleep next to the window.  Little Robert was already asleep and Earl was busy changing into his pajamas.  I climbed into bed without undressing and pulled the blanket over my head.  In the dark I picked at the lumpy baseball I had hidden under my pillow, ‘til I had unwrapped enough twine to make a loop.  I slipped the loop around my wrist and pulled it tight.  	
      Instead of trying to stay up ‘til the grown-ups were in bed, me and Emma were just gonna go to sleep and get up later.  Emma had her own alarm clock, given to her by her grandma.  If she placed it under her pillow, it was just loud enough for her to hear, but muffled so it wouldn’t wake her parents.  I was planning on tossing the baseball out the window, so Emma could wake me by pulling on the twine.  
	I peaked out from under the covers.  Earl was in bed with his eyes closed, but Raymond came into the room and saw me looking around.  “You still awake, Dit?” he asked.
	“Yeah.”
	Raymond came over and sat down on the edge of my bed.  “I’m sorry about Doc.”
	“Yeah,” I said again, praying Raymond wouldn’t notice I was still dressed and had a baseball tied to my arm.  
	“You’re closer to him than any of us,” Raymond said.
	“Yeah,” I repeated.  Why did he have to pick tonight to be nice?
	“Just wanted to say I was sorry.”
	“Thanks.”  
	Raymond finally said goodnight, climbed into his own bed, and turned off the kerosene lantern.  Soon as the light was off, I forced the baseball out the slightly open window.  I could feel the twine unwinding as it fell and heard the soft thump as the ball hit the ground.  The twine felt like an iron chain around my wrist.
	I didn’t think I’d be able to sleep at all, but I guess I did, ‘cause next thing I knew, someone was jerking at my arm.  I sat up.  The room was dark and my brothers were breathing nice and steady.  I peaked out of the window.  Emma was looking up at me, one hand still wrapped around the twine hanging down the side of the house.  
	I grabbed my baseball mitt and carefully slipped out of bed.  I could hear Pa snoring gently in the big bedroom at the end of the hall as I crept down the stairs.  The clock on the mantel in the parlor read five minutes after midnight.
      First thing we did was head on over to Chip’s to get the key.  Emma held the basket with the rabbit while I threw pebbles at Chip’s window.  I could hear the rabbit’s claws scratching at the reeds as we waited.  Finally, Chip pushed open the window and stuck his head out. 
      “I don’t have it,” he whispered.
      “What?”
      “I don’t have the key,” Chip repeated a bit louder.  “I couldn’t get it from my pa.  Ever since Doc got arrested he’s been carrying it around with him.  Even sleeps with it under his pillow.”
      “You promised,” I said.  I couldn’t believe Chip was letting me down.  Again.  
      Chip shrugged.  “There’s nothing I can do.” 
      “Who else has a key?” asked Emma.
      “I don’t know.  Big Foot had one.  Maybe Mrs. Pooley’s got it now.”  He glanced back into his dark room.  “I gotta go.”  He pulled his head back in and shut the window. 
      “What are we supposed to do?” I wailed.  “Break into her store?”
      I looked at Emma.  And we both knew what we had to do.
